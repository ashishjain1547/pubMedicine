<h3>Benefits of Pantosec D Capsule PR</h3>

<b>In Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux)</b>

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-term) condition in which there is an excess production of acid in the stomach. Pantosec D SR Capsule reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes and relieves the pain associated with heartburn and acid reflux. You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective. Some simple lifestyle changes can help reduce the symptoms of GERD. Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller, more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight and try to find ways to relax. Do not eat within 3-4 hours of going to bed.

<b>In Peptic ulcer disease</b>

Peptic ulcer disease is a condition in which painful sores or ulcers develop in the inner lining of the stomach or gut (intestine). Pantosec D SR Capsule reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes which prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. You may be given other medicines along with this medicine depending on what caused the ulcer. You need to keep taking the medicine as it is prescribed for it to be effective, even if the symptoms seem to disappear.
