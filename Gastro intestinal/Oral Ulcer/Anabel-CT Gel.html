How Anabel-CT Dental Gel works
Anabel-CT Gel is a combination of two medicines: Choline Salicylate and Lidocaine. Choline Salicylate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking the release of certain chemical messengers (prostaglandins) which cause pain and inflammation (redness and swelling). Lidocaine is a local anesthetic. It works by blocking pain signals from the nerves to the brain which decreases the pain sensation.

    Anabel-CT Gel helps relieve pain and inflammation caused by mouth ulcers, sore gums and denture irritation.
    Apply it over the affected area with a clean fingertip, three to four times a day or as directed by your doctor.
    Stop using this medicine and inform your doctor if any irritation occurs.
    If symptoms persist for more than seven days, consult your doctor.
