<h2>Product introduction</h2>

Vomiford -MD Tablet is an antiemetic medicine commonly used to control nausea and vomiting due to certain medical conditions like stomach upset. It is also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused due to any surgery, cancer drug therapy, or radiotherapy.

Vomiford -MD Tablet may be used alone or with other medications and can be taken with or without food. Your doctor will suggest the appropriate dose depending on what you are taking it for. The first dose is normally taken before the start of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. After these treatments, take any further doses as prescribed by your doctor (normally only for a few days at most). Take it regularly at the same time(s) each day to get the most benefit. Be careful not to take too much.

This medicine does not relieve other side effects associated with cancer treatments. Also, it has little effect on vomiting caused by motion sickness. The most common side effects of taking this medicine include headache, diarrhea, or constipation and feeling tired. These symptoms should disappear when you stop taking the medicine. However, if these side effects bother you or do not go away, your doctor may be able to suggest ways of preventing or reducing them. 

Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have heart or liver problems or a blockage in your stomach or intestines. Also, tell your doctor about any other medicines you might be taking, especially medicines to treat epilepsy, heart problems, cancer, and depression. These may affect, or be affected by, this medicine. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, ask for advice from your doctor.
