Do not eat within 3 to 4 hours of going to bed.
In Treatment of Stomach ulcers
Stomach ulcers are painful sores that develop in the inner lining of the stomach or gut (intestine). Mucaine Gel Mint Sugar Free reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes which prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. You may be given other medicines along with this medicine depending on what caused the ulcer.
