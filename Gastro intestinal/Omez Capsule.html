<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

Omez Capsule is a medicine that reduces the amount of acid produced in your stomach. It helps treat acid-related diseases of the stomach and intestine such as heartburn, acid reflux, and peptic ulcer disease.

Omez Capsule is also used to prevent stomach ulcers and acidity that may be seen with the prolonged use of painkillers. It belongs to a class of medicines known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This medicine should be taken one hour before a meal, preferably in the morning. The dose will depend on your underlying condition and how you respond to the medicine. You should keep on taking it as prescribed even if your symptoms disappear quickly. You can increase the efficiency of the treatment by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee), and spicy or fatty foods.

The most common side effects observed with this medicine include nausea, vomiting, headache, flatulence, diarrhea, and stomach pain. These symptoms are generally mild but if they bother you or do not go away, consult your doctor. Long-term use of this medicine may lead to an increased risk of side effects. For instance, using this medicine for more than 1 year may increase your risk for bone fractures, especially with higher doses. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis).

Before taking this medicine, let your doctor know if you have or had severe liver problems, allergic reactions to similar medicines, or bone loss (osteoporosis).

Many other medicines may affect, or be affected by, this medicine. Let your doctor know about all other medicines you are taking, to make sure it is safe. This is particularly important if you are taking medicines for HIV, fungal infections, tuberculosis, epilepsy (fits), or some types of blood thinners.
