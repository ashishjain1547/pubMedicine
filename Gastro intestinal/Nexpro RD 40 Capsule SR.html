<h3>BENEFITS OF NEXPRO RD CAPSULE SR</h3>

In Treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux)
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-term) condition in which there is an excess production of acid in the stomach. Nexpro RD 40 Capsule SR reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes and relieves the pain associated with heartburn and acid reflux. You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective.

Some simple lifestyle changes can help reduce the symptoms of GERD. Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller, more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight and try to find ways to relax. Do not eat within 3-4 hours of going to bed.
In Treatment of Functional dyspepsia
Functional dyspepsia is another term for indigestion that is not associated with a specific cause. It may cause symptoms such as an early feeling of fullness after eating, stomach pain or discomfort, nausea, and bloating. Nexpro RD 40 Capsule SR helps treat these symptoms by increasing the rate of stomach emptying. Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully and make appropriate lifestyle changes to get maximum benefit.
