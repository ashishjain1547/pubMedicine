<b>Product introduction</b>

Tilrx Tablet is an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections in your body. It is effective in infections of the lungs (e.g., pneumonia), ear, throat, nasal sinus, urinary tract, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints. It is also used to prevent infections during surgery.

Tilrx Tablet should be taken with food to avoid an upset stomach. Take it regularly at evenly spaced intervals as per the schedule prescribed by your doctor. Taking it at the same time every day will help you remember to take it. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for and the severity of your condition. Make sure to complete the full course. It will not work for viral infections such as the flu or the common cold. Using any antibiotic when you do not need it can make it less effective for future infections.

The most common side effects of this medicine include rash, vomiting, increased liver enzymes, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild, but let your doctor know if they bother you or last more than a few days.

Before using it, you should tell your doctor if you are allergic to any antibiotics or have any kidney or liver problems.
