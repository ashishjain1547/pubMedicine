<b>Product introduction</b>

Trinephrine Eye Drop is used for examination of the eye for the detection of any eye disease. It acts by enlarging the pupil of the eyes and helps the doctor visualize the eye more closely.

Trinephrine Eye Drop is for external use only. Use it in the dose and duration as advised by the doctor. Using a Trinephrine Eye Drop can make your eyes more sensitive to light. Thus, wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from sunlight and other bright lights. After applying, keep your eyes closed for a moment to allow the medicine to spread evenly. For best results, avoid rubbing your eyes and try to follow a regular schedule.

Common side effects include stinging, local irritation, swelling, and inflammation in the eye. Usually, these symptoms resolve quickly. These symptoms are usually temporary and subside after some time. However, if they persist or worsen, stop using it and consult your doctor. To prevent side effects, avoid overuse, and make sure you do not touch the tip of the dropper to any surface, including your eyes, to maintain its sterility.

When using Trinephrine Eye Drop, avoid engaging in activities requiring clear vision, such as driving, until you are sure your vision is no longer blurry. Do not use the medicine if you have a known history of allergic reactions to any of its ingredients.
