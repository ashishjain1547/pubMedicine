<b>3. Beclomethasone Dipropionate (in the form of topical cream) </b>

Following information is about the 'Beclometasone' chemical compound.

Beclometasone, also known as beclometasone dipropionate, and sold under the brand name Qvar among others, is a steroid medication. It is available as an inhaler, cream, pills, and nasal spray. The inhaled form is used in the long-term management of asthma. The cream may be used for dermatitis and psoriasis. The pills have been used to treat ulcerative colitis. The nasal spray is used to treat allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps.

Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy. Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid.

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 153rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions.

<b>Side effects</b>

Common side effects with the inhaled form include respiratory infections, headaches, and throat inflammation. Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. Long-term use of the pill form may cause adrenal insufficiency. The pills may also cause mood or personality changes. The inhaled form is generally regarded as safe in pregnancy.

Occasionally, it may cause a cough upon inhalation. Deposition on the tongue and throat may promote oral candidiasis, which appears as a white coating, possibly with irritation. This may usually be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after using the inhaler. Other adverse drug reaction side effects may rarely include: a smell similar to burning plastic, unpleasant taste, hoarseness or nasal congestion, pain or headache, and visual changes. Allergic reactions may occur, but rarely.

Nasal corticosteroids may be associated with central serous retinopathy.

<b>Pharmacology</b>
Beclometasone is mainly a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression).

Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation.

<b>Names </b>
Beclometasone dipropionate is the INN (International nonproprietary name) modified and beclomethasone dipropionate is the USAN and former BAN. It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). The prodrug beclometasone is marketed in Norway and Russia.

Clenil, Qvar are brandnames for the inhalers. Beconase, Alanase, Vancenase, Qnasl for the nasal spray or aerosol.

<b>4. Bilastine (in the tablet form) </b>

Bilastine (sold under the brand names BILLASI and Blexten, among others), is a second-generation antihistamine medication which is used in the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria (hives).

It exerts its effect as a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, and has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. It was developed in Spain by FAES Farma.

Bilastine is approved in the European Union for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria, but it is not approved for any use in the United States. Bilastine meets the current European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA) criteria for medication used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Bilastine has been effective in the treatment of diseases of allergies, including rhinoconjuctivitis. Additionally, bilastine has been shown to improve quality of life, and all nasal and eye symptoms related to allergic rhinitis.

<b>Side effects </b>

Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45–75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits.

In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease.
