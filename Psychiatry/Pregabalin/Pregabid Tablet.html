<h2>BENEFITS OF PREGABID CAPSULE</h2>

In Treatment of Neuropathic pain

Pregabid 75 Capsule is used to treat long-lasting (chronic) pain caused by nerve damage due to diabetes, shingles, or spinal cord injury. It reduces pain and its associated symptoms such as mood changes, sleep problems, and tiredness. It is thought to work by interfering with pain signals that travel through the damaged nerves and the brain. Taking this medicine regularly will improve your physical and social functioning and overall quality of life. It takes a few weeks to work so you need to take it regularly even if you feel it is not doing any good. Once your symptoms have gone you should still keep taking the medicine until your doctor advises you to stop.

In Treatment of Epilepsy/Seizures

Pregabid 75 Capsule belongs to a group of medicines called anticonvulsants which are used to treat some forms of epilepsy in adults. It is thought to work by slowing down nerve impulses in the brain which cause seizures (fits). It helps reduce symptoms such as confusion, uncontrollable jerking movements, loss of awareness, and fear or anxiety. It will help you go about your daily activities with more confidence and may allow you to do some activities that you would otherwise be forbidden or scared to do (such as swimming and driving). It can take a few weeks for this medicine to work and during this time you may still have seizures. Do not stop using this medicine even if you feel well until your doctor advises you to. Missing doses may trigger a seizure.

In Treatment of Fibromyalgia

Pregabid 75 Capsule may also be used to treat pain in people with fibromyalgia. It reduces pain and also the mood changes, sleep problems, and tiredness that can be caused by the pain. It interferes with pain messages traveling through the brain. Keep taking the medicine until your doctor advises you to stop.
