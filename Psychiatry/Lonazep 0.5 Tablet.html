<h2>Introduction</h2>

Lonazep 0.5mg Tablet is a prescription medicine used to treat epilepsy (seizures) and anxiety disorder. It helps to decrease the abnormal and excessive activity of the nerve cells and calms the brain.

Lonazep 0.5mg Tablet may be taken with or without food. However, take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor as it has a high potential of habit-forming. If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember it and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. You should not stop this medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor as it may increase the seizure frequency and can cause nausea, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, and muscle pain.

Some common side effects of this medicine include fatigue, depression and impaired coordination. It may also cause dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. It is important to inform your doctor if you develop any unusual changes in mood or depression as this medicine may cause suicidal thoughts.

<h2>Benefits of Lonazep Tablet</h2>

In Treatment of Anxiety disorder

Lonazep 0.5mg Tablet stops your brain from releasing the chemicals that make you feel anxious so it can reduce the symptoms of excessive anxiety and worry. It can also reduce feelings of restlessness, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, feeling irritable and sleep problems that often come with Anxiety Disorder. It will therefore help you go about your daily activities more easily and be more productive. Keep taking this medicine even if you feel well. Stopping suddenly can cause serious problems.

In Treatment of Epilepsy/Seizures

Lonazep 0.5mg Tablet slows down electrical signals in the brain which cause seizures (fits). It can also help reduce symptoms such as confusion, uncontrollable jerking movements, loss of awareness, and fear or anxiety. The medicine can allow you to do some activities that you would otherwise be forbidden or scared to do (such as swimming and driving). It can take a few weeks for this medicine to work (because the dose has to be increased slowly) and during this time you may still have seizures. Do not stop using this medicine even if you feel well, until your doctor advises you to. Missing doses may trigger a seizure.
