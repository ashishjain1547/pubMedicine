<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Nexito 10 Tablet is widely prescribed to treat depression and other mental health conditions like anxiety, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is a type of antidepressant known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

Nexito 10 Tablet helps recover from depression by improving mood and relieving anxiety and tension. It can be taken with or without food. The dose and how often you need it will be decided by your doctor based on the amount needed to control your symptoms. Your doctor may start you on a lower dose and increase it gradually. Do not change the dose or stop taking it without talking to your doctor, even if you feel well. Doing so may make your condition worse or you may suffer from unpleasant withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, restlessness, palpitations, dizziness, sleep disturbances, etc).

To get the most benefit, take this medicine regularly at the same time each day. Your doctor may advise you to take it in the morning if you have trouble sleeping. It may take a few weeks before you start feeling better. Let your doctor know if you do not see any improvement even after 4 weeks.

Some common side effects of this medicine include nausea, fatigue, increased sweating, insomnia (difficulty in sleeping), decreased sexual drive, delayed ejaculation, and women may experience difficulties achieving orgasm. Some people may experience sleepiness after taking this medicine. Let your doctor know straight away if you develop any sudden worsening of mood or any thoughts about harming yourself.

Before taking Nexito 10 Tablet, you should tell your doctor if you have epilepsy (seizure disorder or fits), diabetes, liver or kidney disease, any heart problems, or are currently taking medicines for depression known as MAO inhibitors. These may affect your treatment. Please tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking to make sure you are safe.
