It is used for the immediate reduction of very high blood pressure (hypertensive emergency). Controlled blood pressure reduces the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or kidney problems.

<h3>How Betacap Capsule PR works</h3>

Betacap TR 20 Capsule contains Propranolol, a beta blocker. It works by affecting the body’s response to nerve impulses, especially in the heart. It slows down your heart rate and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body. This prevents arrhythmias. It also widens the blood vessels in the body for better blood flow, thereby preventing angina as well as migraine. The exact mechanism by which it prevents tremors is not known, but experts believe that Betacap TR 20 Capsule helps block the nerve impulses to the muscles responsible for tremors. Propranolol helps block the effects of the chemical messengers namely, adrenaline and noradrenaline, that are produced by the brain and are responsible for increasing your heart rate which makes you feel anxious. This way it helps with anxiety. While treating pheochromocytoma, Betacap TR 20 Capsule may be given to block the action of high-adrenaline hormones, to lower the risk of developing dangerously high blood pressure during surgery for removing the tumor.
