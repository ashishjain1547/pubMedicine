<h3>Product introduction</h3>

Clonotril 0.5 Tablet is a prescription medicine used to treat epilepsy (seizures) and anxiety disorder. It helps to decrease the abnormal and excessive activity of the nerve cells and calms the brain.

Clonotril 0.5 Tablet may be taken with or without food. However, take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this medicine in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor as it has a high potential of habit-forming. If you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember it and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. You should not stop this medicine suddenly without talking to your doctor as it may increase the seizure frequency and can cause nausea, anxiety, flu-like symptoms, and muscle pain.

Some common side effects of this medicine include fatigue, depression and impaired coordination. It may also cause dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. It is important to inform your doctor if you develop any unusual changes in mood or depression as this medicine may cause suicidal thoughts.
