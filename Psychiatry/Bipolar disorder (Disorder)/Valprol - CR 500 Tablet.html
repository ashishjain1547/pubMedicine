<h3>Product introduction</h3>

Valprol -CR 500 Tablet is a combination of two medicines used to treat epilepsy, a neurological disorder in which there are recurrent episodes of seizures or fits. It controls the abnormal activity of the brain, relaxes the nerves and hence, prevents seizures or fits.

Valprol -CR 500 Tablet should be taken with food. Your doctor will decide the correct dose for you. This may increase gradually until your condition is stable. This medicine may take several weeks to work but it is important to take it regularly to get the benefit. Do not stop taking it, even if you feel fine unless your doctor advises you to. You may have more seizures, or your bipolar disorder may get worse.

The most common side effects of this medicine include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, swelling of gums, headache, sleepiness, tremor, hair loss and liver injury. Most side effects wear off, but if they bother you or do not go away, tell your doctor. There may be ways of preventing or reducing these effects.

Before taking this medicine, tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems, meningitis or depression or suicidal thoughts. Also let your doctor know about all other medications you are using as some may affect, or be affected by, this medicine, including contraceptive pills. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, Valprol -CR 500 Tablet can be taken if it is clearly needed but the dose may be adjusted. You should avoid driving or riding a bicycle if this medicine makes you drowsy or dizzy. You may need frequent blood tests to check how you are responding to this medicine.

You should avoid alcohol while taking Valprol -CR 500 Tablet, as it may worsen certain side effects. This medicine can also lead to weight gain, eat a healthy balanced diet, avoid snacking with high-calorie food, and exercise regularly. Inform your doctor if you develop any unusual changes in mood or behavior, new or worsening depression, or suicidal thoughts or behavior.
