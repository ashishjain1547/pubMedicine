<h2>Product Description</h2>

Sizodon MD 0.5 Tablet is used in the treatment of schizophrenia (a mental disorder that can result in hallucinations or delusions and also adversely affects a person’s ability to think and behave) and mania.

Sizodon MD 0.5 Tablet is taken with or without food, preferably at night. However, it is advised to take it at the same time each day as this helps to maintain a consistent level of medicine in the body. Take this in the dose and duration as advised by your doctor and if you have missed a dose, take it as soon as you remember. It is important that this medication is not stopped suddenly without talking to your doctor as it may worsen your symptoms. However, discontinue this medicine immediately if you experience Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, and altered consciousness or seizures.

Some common side effects of this medicine include insomnia, sedation, somnolence, parkinsonism, and headache. Initially, this medicine may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure when you change positions, so it is better to rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down. It also causes dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. This medicine may increase your weight but, modifying your lifestyle by having a healthy diet and exercising regularly can reduce this side effect.

You should be cautious while using this medicine as it may increase the risk of developing diabetes, so it is better to monitor glucose regularly. Inform your doctor if you develop any unusual changes in mood or behavior, new or worsening depression, or suicidal thoughts while taking this medicine.
