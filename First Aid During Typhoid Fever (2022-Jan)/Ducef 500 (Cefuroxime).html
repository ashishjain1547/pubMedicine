<h2>Product introduction</h2>

Ducef 500 Tablet is an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infections in your body. It is effective in infections of the lungs (e.g., pneumonia), ear, throat, nasal sinus, urinary tract, skin, soft tissues, bones, and joints. It is also used to prevent infections during surgery.

Ducef 500 Tablet should be taken with food to avoid an upset stomach. You should take it regularly at evenly spaced intervals as per the schedule prescribed by your doctor. Taking it at the same time every day will help you to remember to take it. The dose will depend on what you are being treated for, but you should always complete a full course of this antibiotic as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop taking it until you have finished, even when you feel better. If you stop taking it early, some bacteria may survive and the infection may come back. It will not work for viral infections such as flu or the common cold. Using any antibiotic when you do not need it can make it less effective for future infections.

The most common side effects of this medicine include rash, vomiting, increased liver enzymes, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild but let your doctor know if they bother you or last more than a few days.
