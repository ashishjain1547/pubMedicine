<h2>Product introduction</h2>

Ranitin 150 Tablet is a medicine that reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes. It is used to treat and prevent heartburn, indigestion, and other symptoms caused by too much acid in the stomach. It is also used to treat and prevent stomach ulcers, reflux disease, and some rarer conditions.

Ranitin 150 Tablet is also commonly prescribed to prevent stomach ulcers and heartburn seen with the use of painkillers. The medicine must be taken in dose and duration as prescribed by the doctor. How much you need, and how often you take it, will depend on what you are being treated for. Follow the advice of your doctor. This medicine should relieve indigestion and heartburn within a few hours and you may only need to take it for a short time when you have symptoms. If you are taking it to prevent ulcers and other conditions you may need to take it for longer. You should keep taking it regularly to prevent problems from happening in the future. You may be able to help improve your symptoms by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding spicy or fatty foods.
Most people who take it do not have any side effects but the most common include headache, constipation, feeling drowsy or tired, and diarrhea. If you do get a side effect, it is usually mild and will go away when you stop taking this medicine or as you adjust to it. Consult your doctor if any of these side effects bother you or do not go away.
Before taking it, you should tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver problems. This may affect the dose or suitability of this medicine. Also tell your doctor what other medicines you are taking as some may affect, or be affected by, this medicine. This medicine is usually considered safe to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding if it has been prescribed by a doctor. Avoid drinking alcohol as this can increase the amount of acid in your stomach and make your symptoms worse.

Treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux)
Treatment of Peptic ulcer disease

<h2>Benefits of Ranitin Tablet</h2>

In Treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux)

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition. It happens because a muscle above your stomach relaxes too much and allows stomach contents to come back up into your esophagus and mouth. Ranitin 150 Tablet belongs to a group of medicines called H2-receptor antagonists. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes and relieves the pain associated with heartburn and acid reflux. You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective.

Some simple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn. Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight and try to find ways to relax. Do not eat within 3–4 hours of going to bed.

In Treatment of Peptic ulcer disease

Stomach ulcers are usually caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or Helicobacter pylori bacteria. They both break down the stomach’s defense against the acid it produces to digest food. This damaged the stomach and allows an ulcer to form. Ranitin 150 Tablet may be used to treat these ulcers. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes, preventing further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. You may be given other medicines depending on what caused the ulcer. You need to keep taking the medicine as it is prescribed for it to be effective, even if the symptoms seem to disappear. It may also be prescribed to prevent stomach ulcers from forming by reducing the amount of acid.
