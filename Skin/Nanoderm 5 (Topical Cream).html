<h2>1: Iodochlorhydroxyquin</h2>
Clioquinol (iodochlorhydroxyquin) is an antifungal drug and antiprotozoal drug. It is neurotoxic in large doses. It is a member of a family of drugs called hydroxyquinolines which inhibit certain enzymes related to DNA replication. The drugs have been found to have activity against both viral and protozoal infections.

A 1964 report described the use of clioquinol in both the treatment and prevention of shigella infection and Entamoeba histolytica infection in institutionalized individuals at Sonoma State Hospital in California. The report indicates 4000 individuals were treated over a 4-year period with few side effects.

Several recently reported journal articles describing its use as an antiprotozoal include:

# A 2005 reference to its use in treating a Dutch family for Entamoeba histolytica infection.
# A 2004 reference to its use in the Netherlands in the treatment of Dientamoeba fragilis infection.
# A 1979 reference to the use in Zaire in the treatment of Entamoeba histolytica infection.

<h3>Use in neurodegenerative diseases</h3>

Research at UCSF indicates that clioquinol appears to block the genetic action of Huntington's disease in mice and in cell culture.

<i><b>Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol can reverse the progression of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. According to Siegfried Hekimi and colleagues at McGill's Department of Biology, clioquinol acts directly on a protein called Clk-1, often informally called “clock-1,” and might slow down the aging process. They theorize that this may explain the apparent ability of the drug to be effective in the above conditions, but warn against individuals experimenting with this drug.</b></i>

In addition, a study performed in Drosophila demonstrates that clioquinol can slow the pathogenesis of tauopathy model by removing the excessive zinc in the cell.

<h2>2: Clotrimazole</h2>

Clotrimazole, sold under the brand name Lotrimin, among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, tinea versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina.

Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness. When applied to the skin, common side effects include redness and a burning sensation. In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is believed to be safe. There is no evidence of harm when used by mouth during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane.

Clotrimazole was discovered in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

<h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3>

Clotrimazole is an imidazole derivative which works by inhibiting the growth of individual Candida or fungal cells by altering the permeability of the fungal cell wall. It binds to phospholipids in the cell membrane and inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol and other sterols required for cell membrane production. Clotrimazole may slow fungal growth or result in fungal cell death.

<h2>3: Tolnaftate</h2>

Tolnaftate (INN) is a synthetic thiocarbamate used as an anti-fungal agent that may be sold without medical prescription in most jurisdictions. It is supplied as a cream, powder, spray, liquid, and liquid aerosol. Tolnaftate is used to treat fungal conditions such as jock itch, athlete's foot and ringworm.

<h3>Mechanism</h3>

Although the exact mechanism of action is not entirely known, it is believed to inhibit squalene epoxidase, an important enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol (a key component of the fungal cell membrane) in a similar way to terbinafine.

<h3>4: Gentamicin</h3>

Gentamicin is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others. It is not effective for gonorrhea or chlamydia infections. It can be given intravenously, by injection into a muscle, or topically. Topical formulations may be used in burns or for infections of the outside of the eye. It is often only used for two days until bacterial cultures determine what specific antibiotics the infection is sensitive to. The dose required should be monitored by blood testing.

Gentamicin can cause inner ear problems and kidney problems. The inner ear problems can include problems with balance and hearing loss. These problems may be permanent. If used during pregnancy, it can cause harm to the developing baby. However, it appears to be safe for use during breastfeeding. Gentamicin is a type of aminoglycoside. 

It works by disrupting the ability of the bacteria to make proteins, which typically kills the bacteria.

Gentamicin is naturally produced by the bacterium Micromonospora purpurea, was patented in 1962, approved for medical use in 1964. The antibiotic is collected from the culture of the Micromonospora by perforating the cell wall of the bacterium. Current research is underway to understand the biosynthesis of this antibiotic in an attempt to increase expression and force secretion of gentamicin for higher titer. Gentamicin is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies gentamicin as critically important for human medicine. It is available as a generic medication.

<h2>5: Clobetasol Propionate</h2>

Clobetasol propionate is a corticosteroid used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis. It is applied to the skin as a cream, ointment, or shampoo. Use should be short term and only if other weaker corticosteroids are not effective. Use is not recommended in rosacea or perioral dermatitis.

Common side effects include skin irritation, dry skin, redness, pimples, and telangiectasia. Serious side effects may include adrenal suppression, allergic reactions, cellulitis, and Cushing's syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. Clobetasol is believed to work by activating steroid receptors. It is a US Class I (Europe: class IV) corticosteroid, making it one of the strongest available.

Clobetasol propionate was patented in 1968 and came into medical use in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 180th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions.
