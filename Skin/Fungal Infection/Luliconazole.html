Para 3:

An in vivo study in adult subjects with moderate to severe interdigital tinea pedis and tinea cruris (jock itch) showed that LUZU Cream, 1% is mostly a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19. In a separate trial in adolescent subjects with tinea cruris, in vivo blood levels of LUZU Cream, 1%, were seen to approach those levels sufficient to show moderate inhibition of CYP2C19.
