<pre class="">Laboderm-OC Cream

Prescription Required
Manufacturer: Laborate Pharmaceuticals India Ltd

Pricing: 15g tube for 86 INR (Sep 2019)

SALT COMPOSITION: Terbinafine (1% w/w) + Clobetasol (0.05% w/w) + Ofloxacin (0.75% w/w) + Ornidazole (2% w/w)

Salts as per packaging (descriptions taken from Wikipedia): 

1. Ofloxacin (0.5% w/w)

Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present.

When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA. 

2. Fluocinolone Acetonide (0.01 w/w)

Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid primarily used in dermatology to reduce skin inflammation and relieve itching.

3. Clotrimazole (1% w/w)

Clotrimazole, sold under the brand name Lotrimin, among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, pityriasis versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina.

Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness. When applied to the skin, common side effects include redness and burning. In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is believed to be safe. There is no evidence of harm when used by mouth during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane.

Clotrimazole was discovered in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. 

4. Chlorocresol (0.1% w/w)

p-Chlorocresol is a white or colorless solid that is only slightly soluble in water. As a solution in alcohol and in combination with other phenols, it is used as an antiseptic and preservative. It is a moderate allergen for sensitive skin. 

An allergen is a type of antigen that produces an abnormally vigorous immune response in which the immune system fights off a perceived threat that would otherwise be harmless to the body. Such reactions are called allergies. 

In immunology, an antigen (Ag) is a molecule or molecular structure, such as may be present on the outside of a pathogen, that can be bound by an antigen-specific antibody or B-cell antigen receptor. The presence of antigens in the body normally triggers an immune response. The Ag abbreviation stands for an antibody generator.

<b class="">How Laboderm-OC Cream works</b>

Laboderm-OC Cream is a combination of four medicines: Terbinafine, Clobetasol, Ofloxacin and Ornidazole, which treats skin infections. 

1. Terbinafine is an antifungal which stops the growth of fungi by preventing them from forming their protective covering. 

2. Clobetasol is a steroid medicine. It blocks the production of certain chemical messengers (prostaglandins) that make the skin red, swollen and itchy. 

3. Ofloxacin is an antibiotic which kills bacteria by preventing them from reproducing and repairing themselves. 

4. Ornidazole is also an antibiotic which kills other infectious microorganisms in addition to bacteria by damaging the DNA.
