OINA-TF Ointment
Manufacturer: Saar Biotech 

Salt: 
1: Oilaxacin (0.5% w/w)
2: Fluocinolone Acetonide (0.01% w/w)
3: Clotrimazole (1% w/w)
4: Chlorocresol (0.1% w/w)

<h2>1: Ofloxacin</h2>

Ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. When taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. Other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. An eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present.

When taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. Other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. Use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. Ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. It works by interfering with the bacterium's DNA.

Ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.

<h3>Mode of action</h3>

Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It functions by inhibiting two bacterial type II topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. 
Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated DNA, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division. 

<h2>2: Fluocinolone Acetonide</h2>

Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid primarily used in dermatology to reduce skin inflammation and relieve itching.[citation needed] It is a synthetic hydrocortisone derivative. The fluorine substitution at position 9 in the steroid nucleus greatly enhances its activity. It was first synthesized in 1959 in the Research Department of Syntex Laboratories S.A. Mexico City.[1] Preparations containing it were first marketed under the name Synalar. A typical dosage strength used in dermatology is 0.01–0.025%. One such cream is sold under the brand name Flucort-N and includes the antibiotic neomycin.

Fluocinolone acetonide was also found to strongly potentiate TGF-β-associated chondrogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, by increasing the levels of collagen type II by more than 100 fold compared to the widely used dexamethasone.[2]

Fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implants have been used to treat non-infectious uveitis. A systematic review could not determine whether fluocinolone acetonide implants are superior to standard of care treatment for uveitis.[3] A fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant with the brand name Iluvien is sold by biopharmaceutical company Alimera Sciences to treat diabetic macular edema (DME).[4]

It was approved for medical use in 1961.

<h2>3: Clotrimazole</h2>

Clotrimazole, sold under the brand name Lotrimin, among others, is an antifungal medication. It is used to treat vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, diaper rash, tinea versicolor, and types of ringworm including athlete's foot and jock itch. It can be taken by mouth or applied as a cream to the skin or in the vagina.[1]

Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness.[1] When applied to the skin, common side effects include redness and a burning sensation.[1] In pregnancy, use on the skin or in the vagina is believed to be safe.[1] There is no evidence of harm when used by mouth during pregnancy but this has been less well studied. When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the fungal cell membrane.

Clotrimazole was discovered in 1969. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

<h3>Pharmacodynamics</h3>

Clotrimazole is an imidazole derivative which works by inhibiting the growth of individual Candida or fungal cells by altering the permeability of the fungal cell wall.

It binds to phospholipids in the cell membrane and inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol and other sterols required for cell membrane production.

Clotrimazole may slow fungal growth or result in fungal cell death.

<h2>4: Chlorocresol</h2>

p-Chlorocresol is the organic compound with the formula ClC6H4OH. 

It is a monochlorinated m-cresol. 

It is a white or colorless solid that is only slightly soluble in water. 

As a solution in alcohol and in combination with other phenols, it is used as an antiseptic and preservative. 

It is a moderate allergen for sensitive skin.

p-Chlorocresol is prepared by chlorination of m-cresol.
