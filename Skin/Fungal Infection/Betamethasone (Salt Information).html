Betamethasone

Betamethasone is a steroid medication. It is used for a number of diseases including rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, skin diseases such as dermatitis and psoriasis, allergic conditions such as asthma and angioedema, preterm labor to speed the development of the baby's lungs, Crohn's disease, cancers such as leukemia, and along with fludrocortisone for adrenocortical insufficiency, among others. It can be taken by mouth, injected into a muscle, or applied to the skin topically in cream, lotion, or liquid forms.

Serious side effects include an increased risk of infection, muscle weakness, severe allergic reactions, and psychosis. Long-term use may cause adrenal insufficiency. Stopping the medication suddenly following long-term use may be dangerous. The cream commonly results in increased hair growth and skin irritation.
Betamethasone belongs to the glucocorticoid class of medication. It is a stereoisomer of dexamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature).

Betamethasone was patented in 1958, and approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. The cream and ointment are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, the pills and injectable solutions are more expensive than the cream.

<h2>Forms</h2>

Betamethasone is available in a number of compound forms: 

- betamethasone dipropionate (branded as Diprosone, Diprolene, Celestamine, Procort (in Pakistan), and others), 

- betamethasone sodium phosphate (branded as Bentelan in Italy) and 

- betamethasone valerate (branded as Audavate, Betnovate, Celestone, Fucibet, and others). 

- In the United States and Canada, betamethasone is mixed with clotrimazole and sold as Lotrisone and Lotriderm. 

- It is also available in combination with salicylic acid (branded as Diprosalic) for using in psoriatic skin conditions. 

- In some countries, it is also sold mixed with both clotrimazole and gentamicin to add an antibacterial agent to the mix.

- Betamethasone sodium phosphate mixed with betamethasone acetate is available in the United States as Celestone Soluspan.
