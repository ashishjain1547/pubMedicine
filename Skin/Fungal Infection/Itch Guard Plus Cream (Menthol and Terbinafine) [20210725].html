<h3>Terbinafine </h3>
- Wikipedia, 20210725

Terbinafine, sold under the brand name Lamisil among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. The cream and ointment are effective for nail infections.

Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Use during pregnancy is not typically recommended.

<b class="">The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated.</b> Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make sterols. It appears to result in fungal cell death.

Terbinafine was discovered in 1991. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 307th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.

<h3>Menthol</h3>

Menthol is an organic compound made synthetically or obtained from the oils of corn mint, peppermint, or other mints. It is a waxy, crystalline substance, clear or white in color, which is solid at room temperature and melts slightly above.

The main form of menthol occurring in nature is (−)-menthol, which is assigned the (1R,2S,5R) configuration. Menthol has local anesthetic and counterirritant qualities, and it is widely used to relieve minor throat irritation. Menthol also acts as a weak κ-opioid receptor agonist.

In 2017, it was the 193rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.
