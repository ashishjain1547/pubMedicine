<b>1. Adenosine </b>

Adenosine is an organic compound that occurs widely in nature in the form of diverse derivatives. The molecule consists of an adenine attached to a ribose via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine is one of four nucleoside building blocks to RNA, which is essential for all life. Its derivatives include the energy carriers adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pervasive in signal transduction. Adenosyl (Ad) is the radical formed by removal of the 5′-hydroxy (OH) group. Ad is found in vitamin B12 and the radical SAM enzymes. Adenosine is also used as a medication.

Anti-inflammatory properties
Adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. Topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation.

Methotrexate's anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release.

<b>Central nervous system</b>
<b><i>In general, adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (CNS). Caffeine's stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors, thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the CNS. This reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate.</i></b> Experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate Trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine A2A receptor.

Hair: Adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair. A 2013 study compared topical adenosine with minoxidil in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was not superior to minoxidil and further trials were needed. Available in the form of serum such as Folliserum.

Sleep
The principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induce sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. They also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the third hour, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated.

<b>2. Niacinamide</b>

Nicotinamide (NAM) is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. As a supplement, it is used by mouth to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency). While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing. As a cream, it is used to treat acne. It is a water soluble vitamin.

Side effects are minimal. At high doses liver problems may occur. Normal amounts are safe for use during pregnancy. Nicotinamide is in the vitamin B family of medications, specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. Foods that contain nicotinamide include yeast, meat, milk, and green vegetables.

Nicotinamide was discovered between 1935 and 1937. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Nicotinamide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Commercially, nicotinamide is made from either nicotinic acid or nicotinonitrile. In a number of countries grains have nicotinamide added to them.

Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

Niacinamide has a vital role in growing long and strong hair due to its circulation boosting properties. It enhances the appearance and feel of hair, by increasing body, suppleness, sheen. It also improves the texture of hair that has been physically/chemically damaged by helping to build Keratin.

<b>3. Procapil</b>

The revolutionary patented formula PROCAPIL™ is based on a modified, high potency biotin molecule along with potent organic vasodilators and antioxidants, clinically proven to boost new hair growth by up to 121% along with reducing hair loss by 46%+. The effect is due to its DHT-blocking mechanism which fights baldness at the source.

Two-thirds of men are affected by male pattern baldness; with 40% experiencing noticeable hair loss at age 35; Few things can undermine a man’s confidence more than seeing his hair thinning and those dreaded bald spots while styling his hair; Hair implants can be absurdly expensive and most of the over-the-counter products available in the market many times cause more harm than good, which is exactly why PROCAPIL™ was created.

PROCAPIL™ is a trademark name by Sederma for the patented compound Biotinyl Tripeptide-1. Procapil is a new breakthrough formula that strengths hair and prevents hair loss naturally; A herbal complex containing natural active ingredients that help to firmly anchor hair follicles in the scalp and make the cells of the own hair bulb denser, allowing them to keep hair young and healthy.

Procapil™ is a combination of a vitaminated matrikine with apigenin and oleanolic acid from olive tree leaves to fight the follicle aging process to prevent hair loss.

Procapil™ targets the main causes of alopecia: poor scalp micro-circulation, follicle aging and follicle atrophy caused by dihydrotestosterone to form 2 powerful functions that target the main areas of hair loss.

The first function facilitates the communication of cells and holds these cells together in order to prevent the effects of DHT. DHT stands for Dihydrotestosterone- it is a chemical derivative of testosterone which plays a major role in hair loss.

It is formed when the metabolism of androgen interacts with an enzyme named 5-alpha-reductase. It’s generally found in the prostate glands, testes, adrenal glands, and hair follicles.

When DHT reaches the dermal papilla cells-which divide and differentiates to form new hair follicles- it undermines the absorption of essential nutrients for healthy hair follicles. Fortunately, with scientific improvements, Procapil™ greatly reduces the effect of DHT on hair follicles.

The second function raises blood flow in the scalp which allows the hair to be well nourished, resulting in thickening of thin starving hair.

Clinical studies have been undertaken and have received astonishing results. The mitotic rate of cells increased in the root sheath after 2 weeks, which clearly indicated enhanced cell proliferation. Procapil™ activates a number of genes responsible for tissue repair mechanisms which prove that it provides protecting and repairing effects, keeping hair strong and healthy.

Hair follicles incubated for 14 days proved a 121 percent increase in growth stimulation. 18 volunteers were given the opportunity to partake in a Procapil™ experiment, and after 4 months, 67 percent of those people had their anagen hair number increased up to 46 percent.

This proves that Procapil™ has the perfect natural ingredient for hair growth with no long or short-term side effects.

<b>5. Melatonin </b>

Melatonin is a hormone, released primarily by the pineal gland, that regulates the sleep–wake cycle. As a dietary supplement, it often is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia — such as from jet lag or from shift work; it typically is taken by mouth. Evidence of its benefit for this use, however, is not strong. A 2017 review found that sleep onset occurred six minutes faster with use, but found no change in total time asleep. The melatonin receptor agonist medication ramelteon may work as well as melatonin supplements, at greater cost but with different adverse effects, for some sleep conditions.

Side effects from melatonin supplements are minimal at low doses for short durations. They may include somnolence (sleepiness), headaches, nausea, diarrhea, abnormal dreams, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, migraine, lethargy, psychomotor hyperactivity, dizziness, hypertension, abdominal pain, heartburn, mouth ulcers, dry mouth, hyperbilirubinaemia, dermatitis, night sweats, pruritus, rash, dry skin, pain in the extremities, symptoms of menopause, chest pain, glycosuria (sugar in the urine), proteinuria (protein in the urine), abnormal liver function tests, increased weight, tiredness, mood swings, aggression and feeling hungover. Its use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding or for those with liver disease.

In animals (including humans), melatonin is involved in synchronizing the circadian rhythm, including sleep–wake timing, blood pressure regulation, and seasonal reproduction. Many of its effects are through activation of the melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as an antioxidant. In plants, it functions to defend against oxidative stress. It is also present in various foods.

Melatonin was discovered in 1958. It is sold over the counter in Canada and the United States; in the United Kingdom, it is a prescription-only medication. It is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any medical use. In Australia and the European Union, it is indicated for difficulty sleeping in people over the age of 54. In the European Union, it is indicated for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. It was approved for medical use in the European Union in 2007. 

Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

Note:
When eyes receive light from the sun, the pineal gland's production of melatonin is inhibited and the hormones produced keep the human awake. When the eyes do not receive light, melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and the human becomes tired.

Studies have shown melatonin applied topically can help promote hair growth in people with diffuse hair loss, the most common type of hair loss associated with aging. Melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant, providing protection against cell-destroying free radicals.

- Cococin has protiens, amino acids, sugars, vitamins and minerals that promote cell proliferation.
- Niacinamide reduces scalp inflammation.
- Procapil improves hair anchoring.
- The product does not say what it has melatonin for.</i>

<b>6. Grace Tricho Gold – Multivitamin and mineral complex combined with essential herbs </b>

Vitamin A
Vitamin A is necessary for proper cell growth. It helps to produce sebum on the scalp preventing hair from drying out and breaking. It is important to note that there is a possibility to acquire too much Vitamin A, which can be counterproductive to hair growth.

Panay Ginseng Root
Based on one clinical study, ginseng and hair growth may in fact be linked, helping to prevent hair loss and regrow hair in people with alopecia areata.

Tagetes Erects (Marigold) flower extract
Marigold is often used to hydrate the scalp and get rid of dandruff. Regular application may reduce dandruff infested hair. Dandruff is one of the major causes of hair loss. Another cause is damaged scalp. This oil can heal both these conditions, giving your hair a chance to grow stronger.

Ginkgo Biloba
Ginkgo biloba is believed to increase blood flow to the brain and is a popular herb for hair loss. It is thought to generate hair growth by providing more nutrients to the hair follicles.

<b>7. Grace Cal D3 – Calcium combined with Grape Seed and Garlic </b>

Calcium
Calcium is one of the most vital minerals required to ensure proper growth, reproduction and maintenance of the body. When there is not sufficient Vitamin D (not only required for absorbing calcium) hair loss may be experienced.

Garlic
The sulfur and selenium contained within garlic can help fortify the structure of the hair shaft, meaning it cannot only help to replenish lost hair, but can strengthen existing hair as well. The vitamins and minerals that each clove of garlic is imbued with can also naturally condition your hair while adding strength.

Grape Seed
Grape seed extract is a great choice for hair care as it contains vitamin E, necessary for hair growth and health. The extensive proteins, minerals, and the linoleic acid it contains also offer significant benefits for hair health. The OPC’s (Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins) that are in contained in the grape seed, inhibit the production of DHT, one of the main factors in hair loss. The OPC’s also stimulate hair follicles, promoting healthy hair growth. Grape seed extract lowers the amount of DHT in the hair follicles, meaning that it will stimulate the follicles so they are healthy, allowing new, healthy hair to grow quickly.

<b>8. Grace Tricho Flax Cod Liver and Evening Primrose Oil </b>

Cod Liver Oil
Due to the high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin A and Vitamin D found in the cod liver oil, it minimises hair fall significantly. Consuming cod liver oil is one best way to keep our hair shiny and healthy. All these three nutrients nourish the hair follicles from within resulting in healthy hair that is less prone to breakage and hair fall.

Evening Primrose Oil
Men struggle with hair loss and hormones can play a significant role – including in the hair pattern found on your head, as well as the rest of your body. The essential omega-6 fatty acid GLA, comes from consuming capsules of evening primrose oil and can be highly effective in the fight against hair loss.

<b>9. Grace Tricho Ferum – Iron Complex </b>

Ferrous Bisglycinate
Low iron levels lead to hair thinning and hair loss problems – in fact, it is one of the most common problems in men and women with hair loss. Ferrous Bisglycinate is low constipating form of iron and in a clinical trials, 25mg of Ferrous Bisglyncinate is found to be as effective as Ferrous Sulfate 50mg.

Bacopa monnieri (Brahmi) herb
Brahmi is a valuable ayurvedic herb. Rich in vitamin C and antioxidant properties, Brahmi helps to strengthen the hair follicles and reduce hair fall. Plus, Brahmi also calms your mind and helps you sleep better. Brahmi provides not only stronger roots, but also thicker hair and relief from itchy scalps.
Grace Q10S – CoEnzyme Q10 Complex

<b>10. CoEnzyme Q10 </b>
Co-Q10 is provided to help boost cellular functions. The aging process and disease are thought to deplete Q10 levels, which is why supplements of this kind become useful.

Dimethyl sulfone (MSM)
The reason that Organic Sulfur / MSM plays such an important role in hair growth and follicle strength is quite simple — Keratin depends on access to steady, available sulfur in the body. Keratin is a fibrous protein that provides the base building blocks and structure for hair, skin and nails. Keratin is actually a compound and depends on adequate Organic Sulfur to create strong di-sulfide bonds that makes stronger keratin compounds and fibres.

Serenoa repens (Saw Palmetto)
By blocking the formation of DHT, Saw Palmetto is believed to act in a similar way to the medication finasteride.

<b>11. Grace Tricho Protein – Amino Acid Complex</b>

Amino Acids
Through boosting the availability of key amino acids involved in the production of keratin and collagen, it’s possible to combat hair loss and stimulate new hair growth.

<b>Additional Bite of Information...</b>
<b>Trichobacteriosis axillaris</b>

Trichobacteriosis axillaris is a superficial bacterial colonization of the hair shafts in sweat gland–bearing areas, such as the armpits and the groin. It is a trivial disease of worldwide occurrence that is believed to be caused by the genus Corynebacteria.

The condition has been called extensively trichomycosis axillaris in the literature, but because it is a bacterial infection and not a fungal infection, it should be called trichobacteriosis. 

It is characterized by the presence of concretions along the hair shafts, clinically observed as yellow, and rarely as red or black nodules. These concretions derive from bacterial colonization along the hair shaft containing dried apocrine sweat with a cementing substance generated by the bacteria.

Treatment typically begins with shaving the affected hairs and the surrounding area to remove as much of the bacteria as possible.

Doctors may then prescribe topical antibiotics, such as erythromycin or clindamycin. They may also recommend a cream or ointment that contains benzoyl peroxide.

If the topic antibiotics do not work, or the infection keeps returning, doctors may prescribe an oral antibiotic. 

Following good hygiene practices is an important part of both treatment and prevention for this infection.
