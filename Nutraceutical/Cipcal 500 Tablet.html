<h2>Information about Cipcal 500 Tablet</h2>

It helps in keeping your bones strong and prevents osteoporosis. Calcium is used for building and maintaining healthy bones. Besides this, calcium plays a very important role in the body as it is necessary for the normal functioning of nerves, cells, and muscles. Our body can get calcium from one of two sources, namely food/diet or bones. When food fails to meet your body’s calcium requirements, it borrows it from your bones. If this happens over a period of time then it leads to bone loss. 

This tablet has a balanced mix of elemental calcium and Vitamin D3.  While calcium is necessary to keep the bones strong, Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amounts of Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for building strong bones.

Calcium is also essential for the heart and aids in the clotting of blood. This mineral also helps to treat and manage osteoporosis and to prevent calcium deficiency in pregnant and breastfeeding women. The primary function of Vitamin D3 in the body is to maintain healthy and strong bones. It does so by ensuring calcium absorption in the gut and by maintaining adequate levels of two minerals essential for bone health, calcium, and phosphorus.

Take this capsule as advised by the doctor to get maximum benefit. These tablets are usually safe and don’t cause any side effects when taken as per the doctor's recommendation.

<h2>Key Benefits of Cipcal 500 Tablet</h2>

Improves the levels of calcium and Vitamin D in your body.

Calcium: Your body cannot produce calcium on its own, so you have to rely on diet and supplements to meet your calcium needs. A lack of calcium could lead to a condition called rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in later life. The symptoms of calcium deficiency include weak nails that break easily, dry and rough hair, dry and scaly skin, and muscle cramps.

Vitamin D: It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods but is available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin D3 deficiency is said to be associated with increased risk of osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones), osteomalacia (softening of the bones), and rickets (a condition in which the mineralization of the bone tissue does not occur properly which can lead to bone softening and occurrence of bone deformities).
