<h3>Introduction</h3>

Tusq-X Plus Expectorant effectively treats wet cough (cough with mucus) in children. It helps in thinning the mucus by increasing its water content. This relieves throat irritation and clears congestion, enabling easy breathing in your child.

Give Tusq-X Plus Expectorant to your child orally, with or without food. Give it with food to reduce the chances of stomach upset. You may be required to give this medicine to your child for a few days to weeks, depending upon your child’s clinical condition and severity of the illness. Do not stop the medication abruptly by yourself, even if your child starts to feel better. Continue the medicine until the prescribed course is complete. Do not give more than the prescribed dose for fast relief as it may cause unwanted effects and worsen your child’s condition.

If your child vomits soon after taking Tusq-X Plus Expectorant, help the child calm down and repeat the same dose. Skip the dose if it is time for the next dose. Do not overdose to catch up for the missed one. Do not give this medicine to your child for the long term without consulting your child’s doctor. Check the medicine label thoroughly and never combine this medicine with other cold and flu medicines as that may lead to side effects.

Tusq-X Plus Expectorant may have some common and temporary side effects. These may include excessive salivation, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach discomfort, irregular heartbeat, rash, tremors, and numbness or tingling sensation in the hands or feet. In case of worrisome episodes, call your child’s doctor right away.

Narrate your child’s complete medical history, including any previous episode of respiratory illness, allergy, heart problems, blood disorders, birth defects, airway obstruction, lung anomaly, sinus issues, liver impairment, and kidney malfunction. This information is critical for dose alterations and for planning your child’s overall treatment.

<h3>Benefits of Tusq-X Plus Expectorant</h3>
<b class="">In Treatment of Cough with mucus</b>

Tusq-X Plus Expectorant helps gently soothe and relieve your child’s cough. It loosens thick mucus by increasing the water level of the mucus, thereby making it easier to cough out. This makes breathing easy and reduces the frequency of coughing. 

Along with medications, drinking lukewarm water and gargling with warm salt water may also help ease symptoms for your child.

<h3>How Tusq-X Plus Expectorant works</h3>

Tusq-X Plus Expectorant contains three active medicines. Each ingredient present in this medicine plays a pivotal role. 

1. Ambroxol is a mucolytic that thins and loosens mucus (phlegm), making it easier to cough out. 

2. Guaifenesin is an expectorant that decreases the stickiness of the mucus and helps in its removal from the airways. 

3. Terbutaline is a bronchodilator that relaxes and widens the muscles in the airways.

<h3>Bronchodilator</h3>

Bronchodilators are a type of medication that make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs and widening the airways (bronchi). They're often used to treat long-term conditions where the airways may become narrow and inflamed, such as: asthma, a common lung condition caused by inflammation of the airways.

<h3>Expectorant</h3>

A medicine which promotes the secretion of sputum by the air passages, used to treat coughs.

<h3>Mucoactive agent</h3>

Mucoactive agents are a class of chemical agents that aid in the clearance of mucus from the upper and lower airways, including the lungs, bronchi, and trachea. Mucoactive drugs include expectorants, mucolytics, mucoregulators, and mucokinetics.

<h3>Quick tips</h3>

% Tusq-X Plus Expectorant may make your child feel sleepy. Advise your child to be cautious when taking part in physical activities.

% Do not share your child’s medicines with other children, even if they show similar symptoms. Each child is different, and the dose and frequency of medicine depend upon factors like body weight, age, and clinical condition.

% Stop Tusq-X Plus Expectorant and immediately report to the doctor if your child develops an itchy rash, facial swelling, or breathing difficulties.

% Practice self-care tips:

1. Clean and disinfect surfaces after sneezing and coughing to avoid allergies.
2. Give your child plenty of fluids as it helps to thin and loosen the mucus accumulated in the lungs.
3. Restrain your child from having caffeinated products and foods that are spicy and fried. All these can trigger coughing.
4. Make your child gargle with warm saltwater.
5. Ensure your child takes enough rest.
