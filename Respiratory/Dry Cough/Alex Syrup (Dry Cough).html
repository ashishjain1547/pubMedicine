<h3>Benefits of Alex Syrup</h3>

<h4>In Treatment of Dry cough</h4>

A dry cough, also known as non-productive cough, is a cough where no phlegm or mucus is produced. This is irritating, usually associated with a tickly throat, and may be caused due to cold, flu, allergies, or throat irritants. Alex Syrup suppresses dry, hacking coughs. It will also relieve allergy symptoms like watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose, or throat irritation and help you carry out your daily activities more easily.

This medicine is safe and effective. Alex Syrup usually starts to work within a few minutes and the effects can last up to several hours. Take it as prescribed by the doctor. Do not stop using it unless you are advised to by your doctor.

<h3 class="">How Alex Syrup works</h3>

Alex Syrup is a combination of three medicines: Phenylephrine, Chlorpheniramine Maleate and Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, which relieves dry cough. 

# Phenylephrine is a decongestant which narrows the small blood vessels providing relief from congestion or stuffiness in the nose. 

# Chlorpheniramine Maleate is an antiallergic which relieves allergy symptoms like runny nose, watery eyes and sneezing. 

# Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is a cough suppressant that relieves cough by reducing the activity of cough center in the brain.

<h3>Quick tips</h3>

1. Alex Syrup helps in the treatment of dry cough.

2. It is usually taken only for a short time until the symptoms clear up.

3. Measure the syrup with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup, not a regular table spoon.

4. Drink extra fluids to help loosen the congestion and lubricate your throat while you are taking this medication.

5. Stop taking this medicine and inform your doctor if your cough persists for more than 1 week, tends to recur, or is accompanied by a fever, rash or persistent headache.
