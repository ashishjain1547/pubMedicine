<h3>About Kuffdryl Syrup 100 ml</h3>

Kuffdryl Syrup 100 ml belongs to a group of medicines called expectorants and cough products used to provide relief from cough. Additionally, Kuffdryl Syrup 100 ml may also help in providing relief from allergy and nasal congestion due to cold. Coughing (dry or productive) is a body's way of clearing irritants (like allergens, mucus or smoke) from airways, thereby prevents respiratory infection. 
 
Kuffdryl Syrup 100 ml is a combination of three drugs, namely: Ammonium chloride and Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and Sodium citrate. 

# Ammonium chloride helps in the removal of phlegm/mucus from the airways by decreasing its stickiness. 

# Diphenhydramine hydrochloride works by blocking the action of a chemical substance called histamine, which is responsible for causing allergic reactions. 

# Sodium citrate helps in reducing congestion, thereby makes it easier to cough out through the mouth. Together, Kuffdryl Syrup 100 ml provides relief from cough.

<h3>Disease/Condition Glossary</h3>

Cough: Coughing is a body's way of clearing irritants (like allergens, mucus or smoke) from airways and preventing infection. Cough can be dry or productive. A productive cough (wet cough) develops sputum (phlegm or mucus) from the lungs. 

Cough is commonly caused as a response to allergy or viral infection but coughing up mucus is possibly an indication of infection in the respiratory tract. 

If you are coughing out thick, solid white mucus, it indicates that you may have a bacterial infection in the airways. Clear or light-coloured mucus indicates allergies or minor infection in the respiratory tract, and a yellow or green mucus indicates a respiratory infection.
