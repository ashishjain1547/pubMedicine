<h2>EXPERT ADVICE FOR CEFIXIME</h2>

1. Your doctor has prescribed Cefixime to cure your infection and improve your symptoms.

2. Do not skip any doses and finish the full course of treatment even if you feel better. Stopping it early may make the infection harder to treat.

3. Take it with food to avoid an upset stomach.

4. Diarrhea may occur as a side effect but should stop when your course is complete. Inform your doctor if it does not stop or if you find blood in your stools.

5. Discontinue Cefixime and inform your doctor immediately if you get a rash, itchy skin, swelling of face and mouth, or have difficulty in breathing.
