<pre class=""><h3>Saridon: Key ingredients</h3>

1. Paracetamol I.P.: 250 mg
2. Propyphenazone I.P.: 150 mg
3. Caffeine I.P. (anhydrous): 50 mg

<h3>Acetaminophen safe dosage basics</h3>
Ref: <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/acetaminophen-safety-be-cautious-but-not-afraid" target="_blank">health.harvard.edu</a>

Acetaminophen controls pain and fever but does not reduce inflammation, as does aspirin and the other widely consumed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, generics) and naproxen (Aleve, generics). But unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not irritate the stomach and intestinal lining. That means a person who cannot tolerate NSAIDs can still take acetaminophen. It's an important drug for controlling chronic pain in older adults.

<b>How to stay within limits</b>

If you ever have concerns about how much acetaminophen you can tolerate based on your age, body size, and health status, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. Here are some general precautions for avoiding an accidental overdose of acetaminophen.

1. Cold and flu remedies count. When you reach for an over-the-counter cough, cold, or flu product, take a look at the label. Does it contain acetaminophen?

2. Know the milligrams in your pills. In acetaminophen products available over the counter, each pill may contain 325, 500, or 650 milligrams of the drug. Be extra cautious when taking 500 or 650 milligram pills.

3. Stick to recommended doses. When taking acetaminophen, don't be tempted to add a little extra to the recommended dose. A small-bodied person should stay on the low end of the recommended dose range (3,000 mg).

4. Easy on the alcohol. Drinking alcohol causes the liver to convert more of the acetaminophen you take into toxic byproducts. Men should not have more than two standard drinks per day when taking acetaminophen (one drink per day for women).

5. Know if your medications interact. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if any of your prescription medications could interact badly with acetaminophen.

<b>Acetaminophen: How much can you take safely?</b>

325 mg  ##  500 mg  ##  650 mg extended release

Take how many pills at a time?: 1 or 2  ##  1 or 2  ##  1 or 2

Take how often?: Every 4 to 6 hours  ##  Every 4 to 6 hours  ##  Every 8 hours

Safest maximum daily dose for most adults: 8 pills  ##  6 pills  ##  4 pills

Never take more than this in a 24-hour period: 12 pills (3900 mg)  ##  8 pills (4000 mg)  ##  6 pills (3900 mg)

<b>Saridon has 250mg of Paracetamol: maximum daily dosage to sum upto 4000mg => 16 pills</b>

<h3>Propyphenazone: Maximum Dosage</h3>

In India: Dart (300mg/150mg/50mg)

•  The recommended dose of the drug is 75 to 150 mg tablet orally. 
•  Propyphenazone should be taken up to a maximum of four times a day.

<b class="">Maximum Dosage: 4 pills</b>

<h3>Caffeine</h3>
Ref: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678" target="_blank">mayoclinic.org</a>

<b>How much is too much?</b>

Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two "energy shot" drinks. Keep in mind that the actual caffeine content in beverages varies widely, especially among energy drinks.

Caffeine in powder or liquid form can provide toxic levels of caffeine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cautioned. Just one teaspoon of powdered caffeine is equivalent to about 28 cups of coffee. Such high levels of caffeine can cause serious health problems and possibly death.

<b>You drink more than 4 cups of coffee a day</b>

You may want to cut back if you're drinking more than 4 cups of caffeinated coffee a day (or the equivalent) and you have side effects such as:

1. Headache
2. Insomnia
3. Nervousness
4. Irritability
5. Frequent urination or inability to control urination
6. Fast heartbeat
7. Muscle tremors

<b>Maximum Dosage of Saridon based on Caffeine content: (400 / 50) mg: 8 pills</b>

<h3>Based on the constituent salts: The maximum dosage of Saridon comes out to be 4 pills (based on maximum dosage of Propyphenazone)</h3>
