<pre class=""><b class="">How much ibuprofen can I take?</b>
To treat mild to moderate pain, minor fever, and acute or chronic inflammation, 200 mg to 400 mg of ibuprofen will work. That amount is comparable to 650 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin.

Generally, the maximum amount of NSAIDs you should take per day is 3200 mg or 12 over-the-counter tablets. That means if you take a dose every 6 hours, you can take up to 800 mg each time.

<b class="">Can ibuprofen cause liver damage?</b>

Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs rarely affect the liver. Unlike acetaminophen (Tylenol), most NSAIDs are absorbed completely and undergo negligible liver metabolism.

In other words, the way NSAIDs are metabolized makes liver injury ( hepatotoxicity) very rare. Estimates are that 1 to 9 in 100,000 NSAID prescriptions result in acute liver injury. Generally, NSAIDs are very liver-safe.

However, if you have problems with your liver, such as cirrhosis, talk to your doctor before taking NSAIDs. Also, studies have shown NSAIDs can cause elevated results on liver tests in up to 15% of patients.

<b class="">Is ibuprofen bad for my kidneys?</b>

While NSAIDs rarely affect the liver, they have important adverse effects on the kidneys that you should know about. Here is the science behind the problem.

Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs block prostaglandins, natural body chemicals that normally dilate blood vessels leading to the kidneys. Blocking prostaglandins may lead to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, which means a lack of oxygen to keep the kidneys alive. That can cause acute kidney injury.

Acute kidney injury can occur with any NSAID, though naproxen seems to be a bigger culprit. In one study, folks who took NSAIDs had twice the risk of acute kidney injury within 30 days of starting to take the medications. People with existing kidney problems more often get in trouble.

<b class="">The good news is these effects are reversible if you stop taking NSAIDs.</b>

<b class="">Remember, acute kidney injury from NSAIDs doesn’t cause any symptoms.</b> if you are taking ibuprofen for long periods of time, it’s not a bad idea to have a check of your kidney function with a quick blood test. The test may show a rise in creatinine if your kidneys are being affected, usually seen within the first 3 to 7 days of NSAID therapy.
