<pre class="">Saridon Tablet

<b class="">Key ingredients</b>

1. Paracetamol I.P.: 250 mg
2. Propyphenazone I.P.: 150 mg
3. Caffeine I.P. (anhydrous): 50 mg

<b class="">Description</b>

It is used to treat mild fever and relieve pain. It acts as a mild analgesic medicine that is primarily used as a pain reliever. It can also be used to relieve pain such as headache, toothache, menstrual pain, and postoperative pain as well. It is also recommended to relieve pain and fever associated with acute inflammation of the upper tract respiratory and influenza. It is known to be a fast-acting medicine that works effectively with quick response.

This tablet contains paracetamol, propyphenazone, and caffeine as its active ingredients. It works on a triple-action formula that blocks prostaglandin secretion, pain signal transmission along with modulating the intensity of pain. Paracetamol is used for pain relief and fever. It is used to relieve headache, muscle pain, and dental pain. It acts as an analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer). It works by blocking the release of certain chemical messengers that cause pain and fever. Propyphenazone also exerts analgesic and antipyretic effects which help provide relief from pain and also reduce fever. 

<b class="">About Saridon from Wikipedia</b>

Paracetamol, an analgesic and antipyretic substance, has slow onset but has a longer duration of action and is lacking anti-inflammatory properties.

On the other hand, propyphenazone, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is proven to have a faster onset but shorter duration of action.

The combination of paracetamol and propyphenazone increases and prolongs the therapeutic activity of propyphenazone: peak blood plasma concentrations increase by about 40%, and the elimination half-life is prolonged to about 77 minutes.

Caffeine, with a stimulating effect, is a drug that wards off drowsiness and restores alertness. It also enhances the analgesic potency of paracetamol, although a Cochrane review concluded that a dose of 100 mg is needed for an effect – double the amount contained in Saridon.

<b class="">About Caffeine</b>
#1
Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptors and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system. [ Source: Wikipedia ]

#2
When you ingest caffeine, it hitches a ride to your brain via your bloodstream. There, it mimics adenosine, a compound that’s present throughout your body.

Adenosine works like a depressant, slowing you down and making you sleepy. Caffeine mimics adenosine so effectively that it’s able to take the place of adenosine in your brain and liven things up.

The stimulant properties of caffeine are increased further because it enhances the effects of natural stimulants, including:

% dopamine
% norepinephrine
% glutamate
% adrenaline [ <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-anhydrous#caffeine-basics" target="_blank" class="">healthline</a> ]

<b class="">Stats from Google</b>

Caffeine in 1 cup of tea (237.3 grams): 26.1 mg
