<h3>Benefits of Diclomol Tablet</h3>
<h4>In Pain relief</h4>

Diclomol Tablet is a combination of medicines that is used for short-term relief of pain, inflammation and swelling.

In general, you should take the lowest dose that works, for the shortest possible time. This will help you to go about your daily activities more easily and have a better, more active, quality of life.

<h3>How Diclomol Tablet works</h3>

Diclomol Tablet is a combination of two medicines: Diclofenac and Paracetamol. These medicines work by blocking the action of chemical messengers responsible for pain, fever and inflammation (redness and swelling).

<h3>Pharmacology</h3>
Diclofenac, sold under the brand name Voltaren among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammatory diseases such as gout. It is taken by mouth, rectally in a suppository, used by injection, or applied to the skin. Improvements in pain last for as much as eight hours. It is also available in combination with misoprostol in an effort to decrease stomach problems.

Common side effects include abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, dizziness, headache, and swelling. Serious side effects may include heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and stomach ulceration. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. It is believed to work by decreasing the production of prostaglandin. It blocks both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).

Diclofenac was patented in 1965 by Ciba-Geigy; it came into medical use in the United States in 1988. It is available as a generic medication. In 2019, it was the 74th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. It is available as a sodium or potassium salt.

<h3>Quick tips</h3>

1. You have been prescribed this combination medicine for relieving pain and inflammation.
2. Take it with food to avoid getting an upset stomach.
3. It may cause dizziness and sleepiness. Do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how it affects you.
4. Avoid consuming alcohol when taking Diclomol Tablet as it may cause excessive drowsiness and increase the risk of liver damage.
5. Do not take it with any other medicine containing acetaminophen (drugs for pain/fever or cough-and-cold) without asking your doctor first.
