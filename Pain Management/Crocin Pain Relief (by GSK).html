<h3>HOW CROCIN TABLET WORKS</h3>

Crocin Pain Relief Tablet is a combination of two medicines: Caffeine and Paracetamol. 

# Caffeine narrows the blood vessels in the brain to reduce headache. 

# Paracetamol is an analgesic (pain reliever) which works by blocking the release of certain chemical messengers that cause pain. Together, they relieve headache effectively.

<h3>Quick tips</h3>

1. Crocin Pain Relief Tablet is used to get relief from headache.

2. You can take a dose of Crocin Pain Relief Tablet every 4-6 hours if needed, up to four times a day. Remember to leave at least four hours between doses and do not take more than four doses in any 24-hour period.

4. Managing your stress levels well and taking 6-7 hours of sleep at night can help prevent a headache.

<h3>Fact Box</h3>

Habit Forming: No
Therapeutic Class: PAIN ANALGESICS

<h3>Interesting Fact</h3>

The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure.[42] Paracetamol poisoning is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

<h3>Pharmacology</h3>

Pharmacodynamics: Paracetamol appears to exert its effects through two mechanisms: the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and actions of its metabolite AM404.

Supporting the first mechanism, pharmacologically and in its side effects, paracetamol is close to classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that act by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and especially similar to selective COX-2 inhibitors. Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by reducing the active form of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This occurs only when the concentration of arachidonic acid and peroxides is low. Under these conditions, COX-2 is the predominant form of cyclooxygenase, which explains the apparent COX-2 selectivity of paracetamol. Under the conditions of inflammation, the concentration of peroxides is high, which counteracts the reducing effect of paracetamol. Accordingly, the anti-inflammatory action of paracetamol is slight.

The second mechanism centers around the paracetamol metabolite AM404. This metabolite has been detected in the brains of animals and cerebrospinal fluid of humans taking paracetamol. Apparently, it is formed in the brain from another paracetamol metabolite 4-aminophenol by action of fatty acid amide hydrolase. AM404 is a weak agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, an inhibitor of endocannabinoid transporter, and a potent activator of TRPV1 receptor. This and other research indicate that cannabinoid system and TRPV1 may play an important role in the analgesic effect of paracetamol.
