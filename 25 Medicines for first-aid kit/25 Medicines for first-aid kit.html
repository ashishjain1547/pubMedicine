<b class="">1. Nutraceutical</b>

Nutraceuticals is a broad umbrella term that is used to describe any product derived from food sources with extra health benefits in addition to the basic nutritional value found in foods.

The word "nutraceutical" is a portmanteau of the words "nutrition" and "pharmaceutical", coined in 1989 by Stephen L. DeFelice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine. “Let food be thy medicine.” is a common misquotation attributed to Hippocrates, who is considered by some to be the father of Western medicine.

The modern nutraceutical market began to develop in Japan during the 1980s. In contrast to the natural herbs and spices used as folk medicine for centuries throughout Asia, the nutraceutical industry has grown alongside the expansion and exploration of modern technology.

The nutraceuticals can be categorized as dietary fibre, prebiotics, probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and herbal / natural foods.

% Prebiotics are compounds in food that induce the growth or activity of beneficial microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The most common example is in the gastrointestinal tract, where prebiotics can alter the composition of organisms in the gut microbiome.

% Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts that are good for you, especially your digestive system. We usually think of these as germs that cause diseases. But your body is full of bacteria, both good and bad. Probiotics are often called "good" or "helpful" bacteria because they help keep your gut healthy.

% Polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 and omega-6 fats. These are essential fatty acids that the body needs for brain function and cell growth. Our bodies DO NOT make essential fatty acids, so you can only get them from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are also good for your heart in several ways.

% Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, thereby leading to chain reactions that may damage the cells of organisms. Antioxidants such as thiols or ascorbic acid (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions. Note: Tea is a very rich source of a specific kind of antioxidant called flavonoids. The detoxifying effect of these antioxidants protects cells from free radicals.

% Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins. Amino acids and proteins are the building blocks of life. When proteins are digested or broken down, amino acids are left. The human body uses amino acids to make proteins to help the body: Break down food.

<b class="">2. Iodex</b>

'Iodex Ultragel' contains Diclofenac Diethylamine, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with emulgel formulation (for topical use). Diclofenac Diethylamine works to relieve pain and reduce internal inflammation.

Iodex, a trusted pain relief brand (of GlaxoSmithKline) in India for close to 100 years (as of 2020), helps provide effective relief from different types of <b>musculo-skeletal pains</b> like neck/shoulder pain, back pain, joint pain, sprain, etc.

<b class="">3. Boroline</b>

It is a combination of the antiseptic boric acid, the astringent and sunscreen zinc oxide, and the emollient lanolin and is meant to be used for cuts, cracked lips, rough skin, and to treat infections. It is manufactured by G D Pharmaceuticals.

<b class="">4. Levocetirizine</b>

Levocetirizine is an antihistamine used to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, itching eyes/nose, and sneezing. It is also used to relieve itching and hives. It works by blocking a certain natural substance (histamine) that your body makes during an allergic reaction. 
As an example: It is sold in India by Cipla in the form of 5 mg tablets under the name "Cetcip-L".

Levocetirizine, sold under the brand name Xyzal among others, is an antihistamine used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and long term hives of unclear cause. It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth.

Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H1-receptors.

Levocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 175th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.

<b class="">6. Paracetamol</b>

Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, is a medication used to treat pain and fever. It is typically used for mild to moderate pain relief. Evidence is mixed for its use to relieve fever in children. It is often sold in combination with other medications, such as in many cold medications. Paracetamol is also used for severe pain, such as cancer pain and pain after surgery, in combination with opioid pain medication. It is typically used either by mouth or rectally, but is also available by injection into a vein. Effects last between two and four hours.

Paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses. The recommended maximum daily dose for an adult is three to four grams. Higher doses may lead to toxicity, including liver failure. Serious skin rashes may rarely occur. It appears to be safe during pregnancy and when breastfeeding. In those with liver disease, it may still be used, but in lower doses. It is classified as a mild analgesic. <b>It does not have significant anti-inflammatory activity. How it works is not entirely clear.</b>

Paracetamol was first made in 1877. It is the most commonly used medication for pain and fever in both the United States and Europe. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Paracetamol is available as a generic medication, with brand names including Tylenol and Panadol among others. In 2017, it was the 25th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 24 million prescriptions.

Terbinafine oral granules are used to treat a fungal infection of scalp hair follicles in children who are at least 4 years old.

~ ~ ~

Terbinafine, sold under the brand name Lamisil among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat pityriasis versicolor, fungal nail infections, and ringworm including jock itch and athlete's foot. It is either taken by mouth or applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. The cream and ointment are not effective for nail infections.

Common side effects when taken by mouth include nausea, diarrhea, headache, cough, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Severe side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. Liver injury is, however, unusual. Use during pregnancy is not typically recommended. The cream and ointment may result in itchiness but are generally well tolerated. Terbinafine is in the allylamines family of medications. It works by decreasing the ability of fungi to make sterols. It appears to result in fungal cell death.

<b class="">10. Ibuprofen</b>

Ibuprofen is a medication in the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class that is used for treating pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be used by mouth or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.

Common side effects include heartburn and a rash. Compared to other NSAIDs, it may have other side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding. It increases the risk of heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure. At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While it is unclear if it is safe in early pregnancy, it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy and therefore is not recommended. Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs.

Ibuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of trade names, including Nurofen, Advil and Motrin. It was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 28th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 24 million prescriptions.

<b class="">15. Betadine</b>

Betadine (Povidone-iodine) is a topical antiseptic that provides infection protection against a variety of germs for minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.

Povidone-iodine (PVP-I), also known as iodopovidone, is an antiseptic used for skin disinfection before and after surgery. It may be used both to disinfect the hands of healthcare providers and the skin of the person they are caring for. It may also be used for minor wounds. It may be applied to the skin as a liquid or a powder.

Side effects include skin irritation. If used on large wounds, kidney problems, high blood sodium, and metabolic acidosis may occur. It is not recommended in people who are less than 32 weeks pregnant or are taking lithium. Frequent use is not recommended in people with thyroid problems. Povidone-iodine is a chemical complex of povidone, hydrogen iodide, and elemental iodine. It contains from 9% to 12% titratable iodine species (thus 10% povidone-iodine contains 1% titratable iodine species). It works by releasing iodine which results in the death of a range of microorganisms.

Povidone-iodine came into commercial use in 1955. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Povidone-iodine is available over the counter. It is sold under a number of brand names including Betadine.

<b class="">16. Hand Sanitizer</b>

Hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam generally used to decrease infectious agents on the hands. In most settings hand washing with soap and water is generally preferred. Hand sanitizer is less effective at killing certain kinds of germs, such as norovirus and Clostridium difficile and unlike soap and water, it cannot remove harmful chemicals. People may incorrectly wipe off hand sanitizer before it has dried, and some are less effective because their alcohol concentrations are too low.

In most healthcare settings alcohol-based hand sanitizers are preferable to hand washing with soap and water, because it may be better tolerated and is more effective at reducing bacteria. Hand washing with soap and water, however, should be carried out if contamination can be seen, or following the use of the toilet. The general use of non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers has no recommendations.

Alcohol-based versions typically contain some combination of isopropyl alcohol, ethanol (ethyl alcohol), or n-propanol, with versions containing 60% to 95% alcohol the most effective. Care should be taken as they are flammable. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer works against a wide variety of microorganisms but not spores. Compounds such as glycerol may be added to prevent drying of the skin. Some versions contain fragrances; however, these are discouraged due to the risk of allergic reactions. Non-alcohol based versions typically contain benzalkonium chloride or triclosan; but are less effective than alcohol-based ones.

Alcohol has been used as an antiseptic at least as early as 1363 with evidence to support its use becoming available in the late 1800s. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer has been commonly used in Europe since at least the 1980s. The alcohol-based version is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.

<b class="">17. Oral rehydration therapy</b>

Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a type of fluid replacement used to prevent and treat dehydration, especially that due to diarrhea. It involves drinking water with modest amounts of sugar and salts, specifically sodium and potassium. Oral rehydration therapy can also be given by a nasogastric tube. Therapy should routinely include the use of zinc supplements. Use of oral rehydration therapy has been estimated to decrease the risk of death from diarrhea by up to 93%.

Side effects may include vomiting, high blood sodium, or high blood potassium. If vomiting occurs, it is recommended that use be paused for 10 minutes and then gradually restarted. The recommended formulation includes sodium chloride, sodium citrate, potassium chloride, and glucose. Glucose may be replaced by sucrose and sodium citrate may be replaced by sodium bicarbonate, if not available. It works as glucose increases the uptake of sodium and thus water by the intestines. A number of other formulations are also available including versions that can be made at home. However, the use of homemade solutions has not been well studied.

Oral rehydration therapy was developed in the 1940s, but did not come into common use until the 1970s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Globally, as of 2015, oral rehydration therapy is used by 41% of children with diarrhea. This use has played an important role in reducing the number of deaths in children under the age of five.

It works by killing and stopping the growth of infection causing microorganisms, thereby clearing the infection and relieving the symptoms. It also blocks the release of chemicals that cause symptoms such as itching, redness and swelling. Therefore this medicine relieves the inflammation due to these infections.
You should use this medicine for as long as it is prescribed, even if your symptoms disappear, otherwise they may come back. Depending on the type of infection you are treating, this may be several weeks. Even after your skin is completely cured, you may have to apply it occasionally to prevent the symptoms from returning.

<b class="">22. Steam Inhalation</b>

Steam inhalation is one of the most widely used home remedies to soothe and open the nasal passages and get relief from the symptoms of a cold or sinus infection.

Also called steam therapy, it involves the inhalation of water vapor. The warm, moist air is thought to work by loosening the mucus in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs. This may relieve symptoms of inflamed, swollen blood vessels in your nasal passages.

While steam inhalation won’t cure an infection, like a cold or the flu, it may help make you feel a lot better while your body fights it off. But as with any home remedy, it’s important to learn best practices so you don’t hurt yourself in the process. 

Steam inhalation may provide some temporary relief from the symptoms of:

- the common cold
- the flu (influenza)
- sinus infections (infectious sinusitis)
- bronchitis
- nasal allergies
	
While steam inhalation can provide subjective relief from the symptoms of a cold and other upper respiratory infections, it won’t actually make your infection go away any faster.

Steam inhalation doesn’t actually kill the virus responsible for the infection. At best, steam inhalation might make you feel a little better as your body fights your cold. 

Although the results of clinical studies have been mixed, anecdotal evidence claims steam inhalation helps alleviate:

- headache
- congested (stuffy) nose
- throat irritation
- breathing problems caused by airway congestion
- dry or irritated nasal passages
- cough

<b class="">23. Tetanus Vaccine</b>

Tetanus vaccine, also known as tetanus toxoid (TT), is an inactive vaccine used to prevent tetanus. During childhood, five doses are recommended, with a sixth given during adolescence.

After three doses, almost everyone is initially immune, but additional doses every ten years are recommended to maintain immunity. A booster shot should be given within 48 hours of an injury to people whose immunization is out of date. For people with high-risk injuries who are not fully immunized, tetanus antitoxin may also be recommended.

Confirming that pregnant women are up to date on tetanus immunization during each pregnancy can prevent both maternal and neonatal tetanus. The vaccine is very safe, including during pregnancy and in those with HIV/AIDS.

Redness and pain at the site of injection occur in between 25% and 85% of people. Fever, feeling tired, and minor muscle pain occurs in less than 10% of people. Severe allergic reactions occur in less than one in 100,000 people.

A number of vaccine combinations include the tetanus vaccine, such as DTaP and Tdap, which contain diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines, and DT and Td, which contain diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. DTaP and DT are given to children less than seven years old, while Tdap and Td are given to those seven years old and older. The lowercase d and p denote lower strengths of diphtheria and pertussis vaccines.

Tetanus antiserum was developed in 1890, with its protective effects lasting a few weeks. The tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed in 1924, and came into common use for soldiers in World War II. Its use resulted in a 95% decrease in the rate of tetanus. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

<b class="">24. Chloroxylenol (brand name Dettol)</b>    

Chloroxylenol, also known as para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX), is an antiseptic and disinfectant which is used for skin disinfection, and together with alcohol for cleaning surgical instruments. It is also used within a number of household disinfectants and wound cleaners. It is thought to act by disrupting microbial cell walls and inactivating cellular enzymes, and is less effective than some other available agents. It is available as a liquid.
Contents

Chloroxylenol was first made in 1927. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is sold in a number of formulations and under a number of brand names, including Dettol.

Soon after it was created parachlorometaxylenol was then called PCMX, but this was thought to be a poor name and it was renamed Dettol. Then in 1932 it was marketed in Britain and in India. It had a white on green bottle with a white sword depicted. It is sold, in the same style bottle, in Argentina and Uruguay to this day.

<b class="">25. Boric Acid</b>

Boric acid, also called hydrogen borate, boracic acid, and orthoboric acid is a weak, monobasic Lewis acid of boron. However, some of its behaviour towards some chemical reactions suggest it to be tribasic acid in the Brønsted sense as well. Boric acid is often used as an antiseptic, insecticide, flame retardant, neutron absorber, or precursor to other chemical compounds. It has the chemical formula H3BO3 (sometimes written B(OH)3), and exists in the form of colorless crystals or a white powder that dissolves in water. When occurring as a mineral, it is called sassolite. 

Boric acid is often an ingredient in eye wash products. It's predominantly used as a mild antiseptic and to maintain the pH of the eye wash solution. Boric acid eye washes can be used to clean and ease mild cases of irritated eyes.

<b>Additional Note about Polio Vaccines (OPV and IPV)</b>
<b>Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)</b>
Globally manymanufacturers produce the trivalent OPV using Sabin vaccine seeds provided by the World Health Organization except for the Pfizer polio Sabin type 3. Most manufacturers grow the viruses in cultures containing monkey kidney cells and continuous cell lines  (Vero  or  diploid  cells).  POLIO  SABIN  (oral)  vaccine  is  a  magnesium  chloride  stabilised  preparation  of  live  attenuated  polio viruses of the Sabin strains type 1 (LS-c, 2ab), type 2 (P712, Ch, 2ab) and type 3 (Leon 12ab).   Each dose of OPV contains residual amounts (less than 25 μg) of antibiotics including streptomycin and neomycin. No adjuvants or preservatives are used (Sutter et al., 1999).

<b>Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)</b>
Like OPV, inactivated poliovirus vaccine contains three poliovirus strains, Mahoney type 1, MEF-1 (Middle East Forces) type 2 and Saukett type 3.  The vaccine is administered via the injectable route. The viruses are growneither in Vero cells or human diploid (MRC-5) cells and then concentrated, purified and inactivated with formaldehyde (Plotkin, 1999).
