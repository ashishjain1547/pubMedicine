<pre class="">Tinfal (Biotin and Folic Acid tablet)

Tinfal tablet contains biotin and folic acid.
Biotin is vital for cell proliferation which is vital for hair growth. Biotin plays a vital part in producing amino acids which are the building blocks for protein. Hair consists of keratin which is a form of protein. Thus taking biotin supplements helps contribute to hair growth.

Folic acid plays an important role in hair growth. It renews the cells that aid the growth of hair. Folic acid deficiency can lead to premature graying and hair loss.

Folic acid also helps the body improve its circulation. Healthy circulation helps the skin, skin cells and hair follicles to also be healthy which leads to reduced hair loss and improved hair growth.

Tinfal tablet is effective in preventing & treating hair loss in men & women. Shows improvement in brittle fingernails.

Biotin is a B vitamin that helps your body convert food into energy.

Also called vitamin H or vitamin B7, it’s important for eye, hair, skin, and brain function. It may also support liver function.

Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, which means that your body doesn’t store it. As a result, you need to consume it regularly to maintain adequate levels.

Biotin deficiency is so rare that there isn’t enough evidence to establish a Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) or Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for it. However, the Daily Value (DV) for biotin is typically around 30 mcg per day. 

#1 Source of Biotin:

Eggs are full of B vitamins, protein, iron, and phosphorus. The yolk is an especially rich source of biotin.

A whole, cooked egg (50 grams) provides approximately 10 mcg of biotin, or approximately 33% of the DV.

You should always cook eggs fully, both to reduce your risk of Salmonella poisoning and improve biotin absorption. Egg whites contain a protein called avidin, which can interfere with biotin absorption if eaten raw.

Folate (Folic Acid), also known as vitamin B9, is a water-soluble vitamin that has many important functions in your body.

In particular, it supports healthy cell division and promotes proper fetal growth and development to reduce the risk of birth defects.

Vitamin B9 is found naturally in many foods, as well as in the form of folic acid in fortified foods.

It’s recommended that healthy adults get at least 400 mcg of folate per day to prevent a deficiency.

#3 Source of Folate:

Adding eggs to your diet is a great way to boost your intake of several essential nutrients, including folate.

Just one large egg packs 22 mcg of folate, or approximately 6% of the DV.

Including even just a few servings of eggs in your diet each week is an easy way to boost your folate intake and help meet your needs.

Eggs are also loaded with protein, selenium, riboflavin, and vitamin B12.

Furthermore, they’re high in lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that may help reduce the risk of eye disorders like macular degeneration.
