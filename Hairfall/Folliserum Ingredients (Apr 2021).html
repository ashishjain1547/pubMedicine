<pre class="">1. <b class="">Aqua</b>
Aqua: water, when it is used in make-up and beauty products

2. <b class="">Butylene glycol</b>

Butylene glycol is a chemical ingredient used in self-care products like:

2.1. shampoo
2.2. conditioner
2.3. lotion
2.4. anti-aging and hydrating serums
2.5. sheet masks
2.6. cosmetics
2.7. sunscreen

Butylene glycol is included in formulas for these types of products because it adds moisture and conditions hair and skin. It also works as a solvent, meaning it keeps other ingredients, dyes, and pigments from clumping up inside of a solution.

Like all glycols, butylene glycol is a type of alcohol. It’s often made from distilled corn.

There are some health concerns that surround the use of butylene glycol. Some experts warn against its use, and cite it on lists of ingredients to avoid when choosing self-care products.

The risk in using butylene glycol is still somewhat unclear. More research is needed to understand how it can affect your body in the long term.
Butylene glycol uses

Butylene glycol is added to all kinds of products that you apply topically. It’s particularly popular in clear gel-based products and in makeup that glides onto your face.

You’ll find it on the ingredients list of sheet masks, shampoos and conditioners, eye liners, lip liners, anti-aging and hydrating serums, tinted moisturizers, and sunscreens.
Butylene glycol is a viscosity-decreasing agent

“Viscosity” is a word that refers to how well things stick together, particularly in a compound or chemical mixture. Butylene glycol makes other ingredients less likely to stick together, giving makeup and self-care products a fluid and even consistency.
Butylene glycol is a conditioning agent

Conditioning agents are ingredients that add a layer of softness or improved texture to your hair or skin. They’re also called moisturizers or, in the case of butylene glycol, humectants. Butylene glycol works to condition skin and hair by coating the surface of your cells.
Butylene glycol is a solvent

Solvents are ingredients that maintain a liquid consistency in a chemical compound. They help active ingredients that could become gritty or clumpy stay dissolved. Butylene glycol keeps the ingredients in cosmetics spread out and in their desired state for use.
Butylene glycol benefits

Butylene glycol has some health benefits if you have dry skin on your face or frequent breakouts. But it won’t work the same way for every person. Generally, most people who have dry skin can use products with butylene glycol to reduce their symptoms.
Butylene glycol for acne

Butylene glycol is in some moisturizersTrusted Source made for people who have acne. It isn’t the active ingredient that treats acne in these products. The moisturizing and solvent properties in butylene glycol could make these products right for you.

However, there are reports of this ingredient clogging pores or irritating skin and actually making acne worse.

Based on your symptoms, the cause of your acne, and your skin sensitivity, butylene glycol may be an ingredient that works in your skin care regimen.

<b class="">3. ppg-26-buteth-26</b>

<i class="">What Is It?</i>

Polypropylene Glycol (PPG) Buteths (PPG-12-Buteth-16, PPG-9-Buteth-12, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PPG-28-Buteth-35) are colorless or pale yellow, transparent liquids. In cosmetics and personal care products, PPG Buteth ingredients are used in the formulation of bubble baths and other bath products, shampoos and other hair products, skin fresheners, skin cleansers, and shaving products.

Why is it used in cosmetics and personal care products?

PPG Buteth ingredients enhance the appearance and feel of hair, by increasing hair body, suppleness, or sheen, or by improving the texture of hair that has been damaged physically or by chemical treatment. They also enhance the appearance of dry or damaged skin by reducing flaking and restoring suppleness. PPG Buteths help to form emulsions by reducing the surface tension of the substances to be emulsified. PPG-12-Buteth-16 can also be used to dissolve other substances, usually liquids.
Scientific Facts: 

PPG Buteth ingredients are synthetic polymers prepared from small chemical compounds called monomers. PPG Buteths are made from equal amounts ethylene oxide and propylene oxide monomers, and the reaction is initiated by the addition of butyl alcohol. The first number in the name indicates the average number of units of propylene oxide, while the second number indicates the average number of units of ethylene oxide.

<b class="">4. PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil</b>

WHAT IS PEG 40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL?

PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil is the Polyethylene Glycol derivatives of Hydrogenated Castor Oil, and it functions as a surfactant, a solubilizer, an emulsifier, an emollient, a cleansing agent, and a fragrance ingredient when added to cosmetics or personal care product formulations. NDA’s PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil is a semi-solid ingredient.

surfactant: a substance which tends to reduce the surface tension of a liquid in which it is dissolved.

solubilizer: an agent that increases the solubility of a substance.

emulsifier: An emulsifier is an additive which helps two liquids mix. For example, water and oil separate in a glass, but adding an emulsifier will help the liquids mix together. Some examples of emulsifiers are egg yolks and mustard.

emollient: Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. 

HOW DOES PEG 40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL WORK?

PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil is soluble in both water and oil and is traditionally used to emulsify and solubilize oil-in-water formulations. Its foam-enhancing properties make it ideal for use in liquid cleansers, and its soothing and softening emollient quality makes it a popular addition to formulations for moisturizers and hair care cosmetics. As a surfactant, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil helps to decrease the surface tension between multiple liquids or between liquids and solids. Furthermore, it helps to remove the grease from oils and causes them to become suspended in the liquid. This makes it easier for them to be washed away and lends this ingredient popularity in facial and body cleansers. As an occlusive agent, PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil creates a protective hydrating layer on the skin’s surface, acting as a barrier against the loss of natural moisture.

<b class="">5. Apigenin</b>

One of the bioflavonoids, apigenin appears to be catered towards reducing anxiety and causing sedation. Found in chamomile tea, alcoholic beverages, and Bacopa Monnieri, apigenin is unstable by itself yet stable when consumed via foods and herbs. [Ref: <a href="https://examine.com/supplements/apigenin/" target="_blank" class="">examine</a>]

<b class=""><i class="">The Therapeutic Potential of Apigenin</i></b>

Chronic diseases, such as cancer, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and age-related function decline, are major public health burdens worldwide, especially in developed countries. It is believed that a combination of regular physical activity and healthy diet can prevent these various diseases, as well as help in fighting already existing diseases. Particular attention has been paid to a diet based on fruits and vegetables, which are sources of natural bioactive compounds with pro-health properties. The largest group of naturally-occurring polyphenols are the flavonoids, which include flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanols, isoflavonoids, and anthocyanidins. Flavonoids are characterized by broad biological activities, demonstrated in numerous mammalian systems in vitro and in vivo. These compounds act as free-radical scavengers and antioxidants, exhibiting anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects. What is more, flavonoids are able to reduce plasma levels of low-density lipoproteins, inhibit platelet aggregation, and reduce cell proliferation. These properties result, inter alia, from their mechanisms of action: inhibiting the cell cycle, diminishing oxidative stress, improving detoxification enzymes, inducing apoptosis, and stimulating the immune system. Of all the flavonoids, apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is one of the most widely distributed in the plant kingdom, and one of the most studied phenolics. Apigenin is present principally as glycosylated in significant amount in vegetables (parsley, celery, onions) fruits (oranges), herbs (chamomile, thyme, oregano, basil), and plant-based beverages (tea, beer, and wine). The present review is focused on the health-promoting effects of apigenin, in particular through in vivo research.

<b class=""><i class="">Chemically:</i></b>
Apigenin (4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone), found in many plants, is a natural product belonging to the flavone class that is the aglycone of several naturally occurring glycosides. It is a yellow crystalline solid that has been used to dye wool. [Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apigenin" target="_blank" class="">Wikipedia</a>]

<b class="">6. Oleanolic acid</b>

Oleanolic acid is relatively non-toxic, hepatoprotective, and exhibits antitumor and antiviral properties.

Oleanolic acid was found to exhibit weak anti-HIV and weak anti-HCV activities in vitro, but more potent synthetic analogs are being investigated as potential drugs.

An extremely potent synthetic triterpenoid analog of oleanolic acid was found in 2005, that is a powerful inhibitor of cellular inflammatory processes. They work by the induction by IFN-γ of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and of cyclooxygenase 2 in mouse macrophages. They are extremely potent inducers of the phase 2 response (e.g., elevation of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase 1), which is a major protector of cells against oxidative and electrophile stress.

A 2002 study in Wistar rats found that oleanolic acid reduced sperm quality and motility, causing infertility. After withdrawing exposure, male rats regained fertility and successfully impregnated female rats.

[Ref: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleanolic_acid" target="_blank" class="">Oleanolic acid</a>]

Oleanolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid that is olean-12-en-28-oic acid substituted by a beta-hydroxy group at position 3. It has a role as a plant metabolite. It is a pentacyclic triterpenoid and a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an oleanolate. It derives from a hydride of an oleanane.

<b class="">7. Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1</b>

What-it-does: cell-communicating ingredient 

A three amino acid peptide where the famous collagen fragment, Tripeptide-1, aka GHK is combined with Biotin, the well-known supplement for stronger nails and hairs. The result of the combination is Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, a peptide claimed to be helpful for reducing hair loss and for making the eyelashes appear longer, fuller, and stronger.

As for proof, the manufacturer did some in-vitro (made in test tubes) studies that show that our molecule can promote hair bulb keratinocyte proliferation and also helps optimal hair anchorage by stimulating the synthesis and organization of the adhesion molecules laminin 5 and collagen IV. This means that our peptide might help the hair to be stronger and to stay longer in its place, though these are only in vitro results that might or might not translate to real-world use.

<b class="">8. Polysorbate 20</b>

Polysorbate 20 is an ingredient used in skincare and cosmetic formulations to improve the texture, feel, and scent of the product. It is mainly used as a surfactant, emulsifier, and fragrance ingredient. 

Polysorbate 20, also listed on an ingredient label as Tween 20, is formed by the ethoxylation of sorbitan before the addition of lauric acid. The process of making polysorbate 20 begins with sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that can naturally be found in some fruits. The dehydration of sorbitol results in sorbitan. The next step in the process of making polysorbate 20 is ethoxylation, which is a chemical reaction in which ethylene oxide is added to a substrate, in this case, sorbitan. Thus, sorbitan is reacted with 20 units of ethylene oxide, giving polysorbate 20 its name. The final step is the addition of one lauric acid group.

Polysorbate 20 is used in a variety of cosmetics and skincare products including cleansers, makeup bases and foundations, shampoos, fragrances, and more. This ingredient exists in the form of a clear to a light yellow viscous liquid.

<b class="">11. Polyquaternium-22</b>

Polyquaternium is the International Nomenclature for Cosmetic Ingredients designation for several polycationic polymers that are used in the personal care industry. Polyquaternium is a neologism used to emphasize the presence of quaternary ammonium centers in the polymer. INCI has approved at least 40 different polymers under the polyquaternium designation. Different polymers are distinguished by the numerical value that follows the word "polyquaternium". Polyquaternium-5, polyquaternium-7, and polyquaternium-47 are three examples, each a chemically different type of polymer. The numbers are assigned in the order in which they are registered rather than because of their chemical structure.

Polyquaterniums find particular application in conditioners, shampoo, hair mousse, hair spray, hair dye, personal lubricant, and contact lens solutions. Because they are positively charged, they neutralize the negative charges of most shampoos and hair proteins and help hair lie flat. Their positive charges also ionically bond them to hair and skin. Some have antimicrobial properties.

Niacinamide is a water soluble-form of vitamin B3 that has many benefits suited to any and all skin and hair types.

Niacinamide benefits

Niacinamide is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredient. It can help brighten and refresh skin and hair by helping to retain moisture. It can also help regulate oil for more refreshed and balanced-feeling scalp and skin.

Niacinamide for hair

Niacinamide has a vital role in growing long and strong hair due to its circulation boosting properties. It enhances the appearance and feel of hair, by increasing body, suppleness, sheen. It also improves the texture of hair that has been physically/chemically damaged by helping to build Keratin. It also enhances the appearance of dry or damaged skin on the scalp by reducing flaking and restoring suppleness.

<b class="">13. Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract</b>

Sunflower oil benefits for hair and skin: (helianthus annuus):

Besides being a beautiful gift of nature and used passionately by artists, sunflowers contain significant properties for great skin and hair.

Rich in nutrients such as calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc and vitamins A, K and E, it’s used effectively against inflammation and general irritations of the skin. Being very high in vitamin E, it acts as an emollient which traps moisture and keeps skin well hydrated. It also helps prevent damage to cells by ultraviolet light and aids against premature aging of skin by protecting the collagen and elastin content.

Sunflower is a source for beta-carotene which is converted to vitamin A with benefits of protection from sun damage and free radicals. Omega-6 (linoleic acid) which is found in sunflower oil, assists with cell development and treating disorders such as eczema, acne and scarring.

A number of characteristics make sunflower oil also beneficial for hair. The linoleic acid it contains assists with slowing hair loss. The menthol assists with dandruff control while its antibacterial properties help keep the scalp microbial free. Its emollient properties keep hair soft, moist and assist with untangling.

So when driving by a gorgeous field of sunflowers on a European Summer or see an old man chipping away on sunflower seeds in a village, remember the positive effects it has on our bodies for health and protection.

Aeolis uses sunflower oil in its body lotions, hand cream, hair conditioner, hair mask and anti-wrinkle lifting face cream.

<b class="">18. Sodium polyacrylate</b>

Sodium polyacrylate (also called acrylic sodium salt polymer) is a superabsorbent polymer that is used extensively in commercial applications as a water absorbent. It is a white, granular, odorless solid that is not considered hazardous. Sodium polyacrylate is made when a mixture of acrylic acid and sodium acrylate is polymerized.

Ref: <a href="https://sciencing.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-chemical-water-treatment-12372179.html" target="_blank" class="">sciencing</a>

Sodium polyacrylate is an absorbent polymer that is used as an emulsion stabilizer, a hair fixative, a film former, skin conditioner, and a viscosity agent. You will see them as the gel like crystals in baby diapers, which are makes them  absorbent. In detergents it works as a chelating agent, which neutralizes the heavy metals in water & dirt so that the detergent can be more effective at cleaning. It is also used as a thickening agent because it can absorb and hold onto water molecules.

<b class="">19. Adenosine</b>

<i class="">Adenosine in the brain</i>

In the brain adenosine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This means, adenosine can act as a central nervous system depressant. In normal conditions, it promotes sleep and suppresses arousal. When awake the levels of adenosine in the brain rise each hour.

<i class="">Adenosine in the heart</i>
In the heart adenosine causes dilation of the coronary blood vessels that improves blood circulation to the heart. Adenosine also increases the diameter of blood vessels in the peripheral organs.

In the heart adenosine decreases heart rate and in blood it has an anti-platelet action. Antiplatelet action prevents platelet aggregation and coagulation.

<i class="">Adenosine in the kidneys, lungs and liver</i>
In the kidneys, adenosine decreases renal blood flow and decrease the production of rennin from the kidneys.

In the lungs, it causes constriction of airways and in the liver it leads to constriction of blood vessels and increases breakdown of glycogen to form glucose.

<b class="">20. Phenoxyethanol</b>

<b class=""><i class="">Why is it added to cosmetics?</i></b>

In perfumes, fragrances, soaps, and cleansers, phenoxyethanol works as a stabilizer. In other cosmetics, it’s used as an antibacterial and/or a preservative to prevent products from losing their potency or spoiling.

When combined with another chemical, some evidence indicates that it’s effective at reducing acne. One 2008 study on 30 human subjects with inflammatory acne showed that after six weeks of twice-daily applications, more than half of the subjects saw a 50 percent improvement in their number of pimples.

Manufacturers who want to avoid using parabens, which have recently lost favor among health-conscious consumers, might use phenoxyethanol in their products as a substitute.

But is phenoxyethanol safer than parabens for topical use in humans?

There is definitely some craze going on for coconut oil both in the healthy eating space (often claimed to be the healthiest oil to cook with but this is a topic for another site) and in the skin and hair care space. 

We will talk here about the latter two and see why we might want to smear it all over ourselves. Chemically speaking, coconut oil has a unique fatty acid profile. Unlike many plant oils that mostly contain unsaturated fatty acids (fatty acids with double bonds and kinky structure such as linoleic or oleic), coconut oil is mostly saturated (fatty acids with single bonds only) and its most important fatty acid is Lauric Acid (about 50%).  Saturated fatty acids have a linear structure that can stack nice and tight and hence they are normally solid at room temperature. Coconut oil melts around 25 °C so it is solid in the tub but melts on contact with the skin.

<b class="">23. Hydroxyethyl cellulose</b>

Hydroxyethyl cellulose is a gelling and thickening agent derived from cellulose. It is widely used in cosmetics, cleaning solutions, and other household products. Hydroxyethyl cellulose and methyl cellulose are frequently used with hydrophobic drugs in capsule formulations, to improve the drugs' dissolution in the gastrointestinal fluids. This process is known as hydrophilization.

Hydroxyethyl cellulose is also used extensively in the oil & gas industry as a drilling mud additive under the name HEC as well in industrial applications, paint & coatings, ceramics, adhesives, emulsion polymerization, inks, construction, welding rods, pencils and joint fillers.

Hydroxyethyl cellulose is one of the main ingredients in the personal lubricant KY Jelly. It is also a key ingredient in the formation of big bubbles as it possesses the ability to dissolve in water but also provide structural strength to the soap bubble. Among other similar chemicals, it is often used as slime (and gunge, in the UK), a gooey substance often used on television and in fundraising events which is poured over individuals with the aim of causing embarrassment.

<b class="">24. Melatonin</b>

Melatonin is a hormone found naturally in the body. Melatonin used as medicine is usually made synthetically in a laboratory. It is most commonly available in pill form, but melatonin is also available in forms that can be placed in the cheek or under the tongue. This allows the melatonin to be absorbed directly into the body.

Some people take melatonin by mouth to adjust the body's internal clock. Melatonin is most commonly used for insomnia and improving sleep in different conditions. For example, it is used for jet lag, for adjusting sleep-wake cycles in people whose daily work schedule changes (shift-work disorder), and for helping people establish a day and night cycle.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): There is no good evidence to support using melatonin for COVID-19. Follow healthy lifestyle choices and proven prevention methods instead.

<b class=""><i class="">How does it work?</i></b>
Melatonin's main job in the body is to regulate night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. Darkness causes the body to produce more melatonin, which signals the body to prepare for sleep. Light decreases melatonin production and signals the body to prepare for being awake. Some people who have trouble sleeping have low levels of melatonin. It is thought that adding melatonin from supplements might help them sleep.

<b class="">26. Cholecalciferol</b>

Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D3 and colecalciferol, is a type of vitamin D which is made by the skin when exposed to sunlight; it is also found in some foods and can be taken as a dietary supplement.

Cholecalciferol is made in the skin following UVB light exposure. It is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) which is then converted in the kidney to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). One of its actions is to increase the uptake of calcium by the intestines. It is found in food such as some fish, beef liver, eggs, and cheese. Certain foods such as milk, fruit juice, yogurt, and margarine also may have cholecalciferol added to them in some countries including the United States.

Cholecalciferol can be taken as an oral dietary supplement to prevent vitamin D deficiency or as a medication to treat associated diseases, including rickets. It is also used for familial hypophosphatemia, hypoparathyroidism that is causing low blood calcium, and Fanconi syndrome. Vitamin-D supplements may not be effective in people with severe kidney disease.[9][8] Excessive doses in humans can result in vomiting, constipation, weakness, and confusion. Other risks include kidney stones. Doses greater than 40,000 IU (1,000 μg) per day are generally required before high blood calcium occurs. Normal doses, 800–2000 IU per day, are safe in pregnancy.

Cholecalciferol was first described in 1936. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Cholecalciferol is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Cholecalciferol is also used at much higher doses to kill rodents.

Vitamin D (ergocalciferol-D2, cholecalciferol-D3, alfacalcidol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amount of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for building and keeping strong bones. Vitamin D is used to treat and prevent bone disorders (such as rickets, osteomalacia). Vitamin D is made by the body when skin is exposed to sunlight. Sunscreen, protective clothing, limited exposure to sunlight, dark skin, and age may prevent getting enough vitamin D from the sun.Vitamin D with calcium is used to treat or prevent bone loss (osteoporosis). Vitamin D is also used with other medications to treat low levels of calcium or phosphate caused by certain disorders (such as hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, familial hypophosphatemia). It may be used in kidney disease to keep calcium levels normal and allow normal bone growth. Vitamin D drops (or other supplements) are given to breast-fed infants because breast milk usually has low levels of vitamin D.
