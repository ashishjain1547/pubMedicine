<pre class="">Hair fall treatment is very expensive and it starts with nutraceuticals such as Keraglo and / or Follihair.

These supplements contain (for example) 'vitamins, minerals, amino acids, with isoflavones and grape seed extract' in Follihair.

Your doctor (dermatologist) might ask you to take one pill of one brand in the morning and one pill of another brand at night (total two in a day).

Now how much does it cost you?

Keraglo for men: 10 tablets (strip) for 200 INR (as of March 2021)

Follihair (by Abbott): 30 tablets (bottle) for 583 INR (as of March 2021)

If you take these pills for a month to begin with, that means you have to spend 1183 INR every month on a problem as trivial as hair fall that could also be genetic.

The thing to note here is that your dermatologist might not ask to get a full body test for essential vitamins and minerals, for large internal organs, for hormones, etc, but still prescribe the nutraceuticals to you.

The thing to note here is that even excess of vitamins in the body is dangerous and harmful for your body.

For example: Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that's a part of the vitamin B family. It's also known as vitamin H. Your body needs biotin to help convert certain nutrients into energy. It also plays an important role in the health of your hair, skin, and nails.

Biotin supplements can cause problems if you ingest too much. Side effects can include skin rashes, digestive upset, problems with insulin release, and kidney problems.
